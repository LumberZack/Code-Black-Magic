            <Text>“The good thing about wizards,” Beedel said as they neared Ren's lot from the backside, “was that they’re so quick to jump to conclusions.” Beedel made sure he had Ren's attention before continuing, “We can use that.”
Ren was half surprised to see his own house still standing. In the eyes of all things wizardry Ren was now an accomplice to a black mage Arborian. Ren thanked his luck that Grummin had been sent to escort him. Otherwise things might have gone differently. 
Ren didn’t respond to Beedel, his mind was now focused on collecting his things from his workshop. First he needed his gun, then he’d collect as many bullets as he could.
Even though some blind birds have better aim with their shit then Ren did with a gun his crystal infused bullets allowed him to forgo aiming most of the time. He thought it would be smart to arm himself now that he was a criminal. If another fight broke out he didn’t want to sit on the sidelines. 
Beedel spoke as if reading Ren's thoughts, “Go and get your guns, be quick Renny.” 
Ren was wearing a simple button up shirt with long pants. His usual work attire. A change of clothes would do him good. Ren felt the need to dress the part of a criminal now, he believed he had some torn jeans somewhere and maybe a leather jacket. 
Ren was mid thought, preplanning his route through the workshop, when his hand made contact with the door knob. As the door opened slightly without resistance, it caught Ren off guard. He vividly recalled locking this door before leaving. 
Ren's fear spiked, “Beedel!” 
Ren's new accomplice was right behind him but Beedel didn’t notice any of Ren's fear as he strode over, “Yes?” 
Ren's face was frozen, his eyes were glued to the door knob. Beedel followed the gaze and saw that the door was open. He looked back at Ren, with a squint of his eyes and a few moments later Beedel understood.
Beedel kicked the door in. Miraculously it remained on it’s hinges. He stormed in, swords drawn. Beedel was in battle mode and scanned the room quickly for threats. Beedel was so focused on finding an ambush of enemies that he almost didn’t notice the girl laying on the couch covered in blood. One double take later and Beedel saw her, ran to her side and looked back to Ren, “Who is this?”
Ren was crouched behind the doorway looking in. He took a good look at the woman laying on his couch and shrugged, “Is she dead?” 
Beedel shrugged back. “I think it’s safe. It was probably her that broke in.” Beedel gestured to the trails of blood all around the room, “Looks like she was hurt beforehand.”
Ren slowly entered and walked towards the couch, looking around the room as he did. There was blood near the sink. All over the floor, and a whole lot of blood puddling on and near the couch. 
Ren noticed the girl’s beauty, her face was covered in blood, but behind all that she had excellent features. Ren began to daydream and wonder what kind of person she might be. Clearly she was a damsel in distress. Ren thought it would be nice to be the one to save her. It had been a long time since his last love.
Ren was getting excited which led to some confidence. He turned to Beedel with a sudden vigor, “We have to help her.”
“No.” Beedel replied, being initially suspicious of this wounded woman.
Ren gave him a look, so Beedel continued, “Renny we don’t have time for this girl. Our hides will be forcibly stripped from our bodies and if we’re lucky we won’t be alive when they do it. So let’s get a move on.” Beedel looked down at her, he wanted to help too. He thought of the woman he’d chased in the alleys the night before.
Then next words Ren spoke hit all the right nerves in Beedel’s psyche, “Beedel, it’s possible she was hurt during your standoff with the wizards earlier. This may very well be your responsibility.”
“You could be right.” Beedel was doubtful. Trying to determine if this was the same woman, he suspected it might be.
“Right. So we’ll take her with us.” Ren eyes were adamant, “Why are we going to the Dying Wood anyway?”
“I told you, we’re getting out of the city.”
“The city borders right up to the woods. If they are looking for us we won’t make it that far.” Ren replied.
“They won’t be able to track us.” Beedel smiled. “I have a secret way to get there.”
“Oh.” Ren moved closer towards the girl. “If you’re sure.” 
“I am. And I need to talk to someone.” Beedel answered. Pinched between the city and the ocean was what remained of the ancestral home of the Arborians. Most of whom lived in the Dying Wood to this day. Preferring the simpler lifestyle while rejecting the advanced technology.
Beedel added, “Plus I’m pretty sure the wizards don’t know I’m an Arborian, and the treaty will keep them from snooping around in the woods.”
“Right that’s out of our jurisdiction.” Ren was pleased. He’d not visited the Dying Wood since he was a child but his attention quickly returned to the damsel. “So can your family help her?” 
Beedel spoke, “ Yes they can, but that wound looks severe. Can you close it at all?” 
Ren knew what Beedel meant. Many wizards could do basic healing magic. It was usually the go to spells that were first learned by wizards or anyone with the least magical aptitude. Ren replied with a stone in his throat, “Yes. Maybe a little.”
“Good.” Beedel was glad, moving the girl with a fresh wound would prove difficult. “What do you need from the shop? I can start gathering things together while you heal her.”
Ren agreed with a subtle nod and pulled out his crystal. “I’ll need my gun. The holster, a bullet vest, and all the bullets you can find.” He selected his spell and nearly activated it when he had another thought. “I should stay off the arcane network, right?”
Beedel gave Ren a dead pan look. “Yes Ren. Just use your own energy.” 
“Right.” Ren replied. He then made sure to disconnect his crystal from the network. “Alright, guess we’re doing this the old fashioned way.” Ren focused his own internal energy into the crystal to power the spell. A faint green light began glowing around the edges of Ren's fingers. With access to the grid’s energy he’d be able to do a lot more, Ren hoped this would be enough for now.
From the back room Beedel shouted. “Sorry again about your doors!”
“Trying to focus over here!” Ren was close to reaching full charge for the spell. Once there Ren released the magical discharge into the damsel’s wound. She rebounded slightly from the impact of the energy and Ren feared his inexperience with healing would mean the worst outcome. But after another moment he was pleased to see that she hadn’t spontaneously combusted and was indeed still alive.
It looked as though the wound had closed up a bit. Maybe enough to transport her. Ren wasn’t quite sure. But he was quite sure that too many of those unrefined spells would cause more harm than good.
Beedel again called to him from the back room, “I found the gun, but do you really need all of these bullets?” Beedel was staring at the assortment on Ren’s desk. At least a few dozen bullets and not a single one was a duplicate. Each bullet had it’s own unique markings, colours, and style.
“Yes, I do.” Ren called back.  “You have your swords and that power armour. If you want me to be any use to you in a fight, I’ll need all of my bullets.” Ren walked over to the sink as he spoke. At the sink he found a clean-ish cloth and wet it with warm water. He brought it to his patient’s face and wiped away most of the blood. He noticed there was some kind of powder residue around her mouth too, but he made little note of it at the time.
Beedel suddenly came back into the room with a look of playful panic, “Renny. There’s not enough room in the vest for all these bullets.”
Ren looked at him from his crouched position, bloody cloth in hand, “There’s a bag somewhere.”
“Gotcha!” And Beedel sped back into the other room.  Beedel quite enjoyed being needed. It was one of his favorite things to be. As Beedel rummaged around the room he was very careful to handle each bullet with care. Placing them gently into the vest and bag. Beedel didn’t know the full power that these magic bullets contained but he wasn’t ready to die in a blaze of hellfire for making an underestimation.
However it is important to note at this point that Beedel was not aware of the three Golden Bullets that Ren had stashed away in the workshop. Had Beedel known about those, he would have made sure to find all three and bring them with them. Beedel would not have overlooked such legendary weapons even if Ren wasn’t sure about their validity. 
Although the golden bullets did contain a certain amount of emotional ties to his father, Ren suspected the bullets to be nothing more than trinkets. He also had a large portion of his attention devoted to the beautiful woman in tight leather clothing that needed his help. This combination led Ren to forget to mention the hidden compartment under his desk where he kept his valuables, among them two of his golden bullets. The final golden bullet was safely chambered inside Ren’s revolver, right where he had left it last night.
Beedel came back into the first room carrying all of Ren's equipment, weighing it on his power armour. Beedel spoke quickly, the urgency was growing within him, “Renny how we doin? Can she move?”
“Still unconscious” Ren replied. “But stable, I think.”
“Well pick her up, we gotta move.” Beedel began heading for the door, stopped turned to Ren and added, “No time to change your clothes.” 
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” He lifted her firmly but gently over his shoulder. Ren wasn’t accustomed to lifting such weight but he felt that he could manage for a least a minute, maybe two. That’s when he spoke up, “You said you had a secret way to the woods?”
“Yup. Custom made. She’s quite something.” Beedel’s voice was full of pride.
“You meant a vehicle? How is that secret? And Wasn’t your house burned to the ground?” 
“Aye, it was Renny. But you wizards are far from the brightest bunch. No offense.”
Ren was offended, “None taken.”
“Our ride should be unscathed and more importantly untraceable. Just follow me.” 
Beedel led Ren out of workshop and into the yard. They walked down the street and cut through a paved alley. Ren needed to stop for just a moment to catch his breathe. Even at walking pace the extra weight was taking it’s toll. Finally after a few more minutes and a couple more short breaks, they reached the back of Beedel’s place. 
To Ren’s eyes the rubble that used to be Beedel’s home looked as though it had been the site of a meteor crash. Although the houses on either side were surprisingly undamaged. 
Ren was already exhausted by the short journey here. So he was a little more than frustrated that he had just carried an unconscious woman down the street, and now Beedel’s vehicle was nowhere in sight. Ren began speaking with a belittling tone, “I don’t see any…”
Beedel interrupted him with a quick shush. Then Ren realized Beedel was looking around to make sure they were safe. After a few moments Beedel’s attention turned to the ground, he was looking for something. Or rather he was counting something. Ren waited patiently for Beedel to finish. His arms quivered as the woman’s weight seemed to be growing with each passing moment. 
Suddenly Beedel jumped through some of the rubble. He found a line of rope that was connected to the ground and gave it a good tug. This opened an underground hatch. The hatch lifted up from beneath the rubble. It was quite large and made of a dark metal. It revealed the front of a vehicle just underneath the ground. 
Beedel came running back to Ren's side of the mechanism, “Out of the way Renny.” Ren realized he was standing directly in front of the hatch. Just as he side stepped away, some other set of mechanisms launched the vehicle forward just past where Ren had been standing.  
“What do ya think?” Beedel was showing off his pride and joy. That much was obvious. But the vehicle itself was like nothing Ren had ever seen.
Ren had read about when vehicles used to roll on wheels, but the technology was so inefficient energetically that it had long been replaced with modern hovering cars. This vehicle in particular had a sleek silver body that rolled like a wave. It had only a single glass window in the front, and the whole thing was surprisingly large.
Beedel noticed Ren's confusion. That was precisely the expected reaction and it set Beedel’s heart ablaze. “A classic beauty, wouldn’t you say?” Ren nodded, it was indeed beautiful in an old sort of way. Beedel continue his explanation, “It’s got a turbo boosted engine in the back and I’ve even converted it to run off of water. You’d think that would make my family proud.”
“You mean it doesn’t use arcane energy?” Ren asked.
“It’s powered by water Renny!” Beedel exclaimed, “They can’t track us if we aren’t using their precious energy.”
Ren thought about this for a moment and almost conceded to Beedel’s cleverness. “They won’t need to track our energy usage to find us in this thing.”
“Funny.” Beedel rolled his eyes. “You are right though, this will draw attention. But they’ll be looking for us in the skies. So if we move fast.”
“We can make it to the woods.” Ren finished Beedel’s thought.
Beedel pulled a handle on the side of the vehicle and opened the door. “Oh and I call her the Grey Phoenix.”
“”I’m sure she has a name Beedel. We don’t have to call her that.” Ren replied, Beedel gave Ren a look. Ren realized Beedel meant the vehicle. “Right. Let’s go.”
“There’s a seat in the back to strap her in.” Beedel gestured to their nameless party member. He helped Ren open the door and get her comfortable. Then they were on their way. Ren wasn’t accustomed to feeling the bumps and hops in the road. It was unnatural at first, but oddly comforting. Ren was never a great fan of flying.
As they drove through the city, they likely caught the attention of every citizen they passed. There would be very few among them who could say that this was their second sighting of a car with wheels. But to them it was nothing more than an interesting sight on an otherwise normal day in town. Most simply wrote it off, others ignored it completely. 
As the Grey Phoenix roared through the city Ren and Beedel watched the expressions of the folk they passed on the street and they were both thinking the same thing. It was too damn difficult to impress anyone these days.

            <Title>Escape Plan</Title>
            <Text>Outside of a restaurant on the south side of the wizard tower things were picking up for the dinner rush. In the alley behind this restaurant there was a hidden doorway in the brickwork that would reveal itself to those who knew the proper code.
Ren and Beedel were on the inside of the passageway. They had been trying to exit the tunnels for at least fifteen minutes.
“Are you sure you didn’t forget the code?” Ren asked.
“No. No. I definitely have it this time. Just stop talking in my ear while I’m working.” Beedel replied. His plan to rescue Ren was suppose to be quick. Instead it had taken them much too long to find the exit and now Beedel’s frustration only rose as this roadblock persisted.
Beedel tapped several bricks in sequence with his armoured hand. Then they waited for a moment in silence. After another moment Ren began, “Nothing’s happening.” He was leaning over Beedel’s shoulder watching him. 
“Fuck it!” Beedel burst through the wall with his power armour. Bricks flew all around. Luckily there were no passing pedestrians in the line of fire. Most of the hidden mechanisms of the passageway were destroyed.
Ren felt it would be a good time for a humorous remark. But before he began he could see Beedel’s frustration. So he asked a question instead, “Why are you so frustrated Beedel? We’re out now. It’s okay.”
Beedel’s response came quickly, “A lost my fuckin’ house and two years of research notes.” Beedel was in that dead serious attitude again. Ren remembered the smoking state of affairs at Beedel’s lot and didn’t ask a follow up questions.
“We should leave the city.” Beedel looked at Ren who had nothing on him except some shabby work clothes. Then he continued, “We’ll go to your place, first. Get you some protection. Then we leave.”
“Where are we going?” Ren inquisited.
A few people were starting to peek into the alley after the commotion. Beedel took note of this and quickly covered up the big hole in the wall with a nearby dumpster. Beedel was easily able to push the half full metal dump bin where he needed it. Ren realized that this suit of armour gave Beedel a whole lot of strength, but it lacked capabilities when it came to small intricate movements, such as opening doors.
The hole was covered and the onlookers had dispersed. “To the Dying Wood. Let’s go Renny.”
“I told you to stop calling me that.” Ren replied but his tone betrayed him. Ren had gotten kind of used to the name. Of course he was determined not to let Beedel know that.
“Sure thing, Renny.” Beedel smiled as they both ran off, down through the alleys.

            <Title>Battle In The Undercity</Title>
            <Text>Grummin crawled as quickly as he could out of the chief’s den. As he pushed the curtain out of the way he saw several of the rats who previously escorted him scurrying away with their weapons drawn. The echo of the scream was still ringing down in the lower levels of the hole.  
Grummin was relieved to see that his power armour hadn’t been completely dismantled. It only took him a moment to return his gauntlets to their proper home. As he did this Grummin’s keen senses picked up the slightest of movements from behind him. He quickly charged some energy into his gauntlets as he spun around. Grummin’s fist swung around with him ready to release a charged blast of energy.
For a moment Grummin hoped that somehow a feral creature had found a way into the city and was hunting an unlucky Roden. Grummin’s hope was shattered when saw the figure. It was one of his warden brothers leaping at him from a nearby rooftop. 
Grummin couldn’t see the assassin’s face as he was wearing a daemon mask. The attacker was airborne brandishing two small blades. Grummin’s fist was lined up perfectly to connect with the assassin’s core. The force of the punch alone was enough to knock the Draconian to the ground, but Grummin was furious. His anger fueled his strength and he released a large blast at the moment of impact. The explosion of energy filled the hole with fantastic red light and a deafening burst of sound. 
The attacker was sent flying back the way they had come and landed firmly into the wall behind Aizen’s chamber. The Draconian covered in dark red clothing was now unconscious. Through the doorway to Aizen’s chamber Grummin could see several curious faces poking through. Grummin yelled out to them, “Stay inside!”
He received a few fearful nods, as they scurried back into their home. The only one who remained was Skeeter. Skeeter took a few confident steps forward. Grummin would have repeated himself but he could see Skeeter’s determination.
Grummin was still on edge. There would likely be more assassins around. He needed to get their attention and stop this before any more violence occurred. 
So Grummin called out into the darkness, “My warden brothers, it is I, Grummin Irontooth.” Grummin’s voice boomed and echoed through the now silent Roden city. 
No immediate response so Grummin continued, “I have made parley with the chief of the Roden. A dialog has been opened. Our information was incorrect, the Roden are not responsible for the chimera attacks. A rogue witch is responsible for the chimera beasts. Please stop your assault, both of our people want peace.” Just as he was finishing those last few words a heavily armoured Draconian emerged from the shadows at a catwalk about half way to the top of the city’s hole. 
It was Krozan. Grummin could see the shock in Krozan’s face. Grummin was suppose to be escorting a wizard. The look slowly faded into a calculation, then finally it morphed into a devious smile that made Grummin uneasy. 
Several other Draconian assassins revealed themselves in the darkness around the city. They were scattered around to completely surround the Roden city. There was an eerie quiet while Roden warriors gathered on all levels of the catwalks around the city. They were accessing the situation. Most of the assassins were already covered in blood. Grummin suspected it was the blood of the Roden that guarded the city entrances.
Krozan looked long and hard at Grummin. After several moments of silence. Krozan finally spoke, “Who let the rat squeal?”
Suddenly one of the assassins from a few platforms higher jumped down to Krozan’s side. He saluted his leader before speaking, “I did, Sir. My blade missed her throat by a hair and...” The sentence was cut short. The assassin’s head was swiftly removed from his body.
Krozan’s movements were deceptively fast in his hulking armour. Armour that used to be a symbol of fatherhood and pride to Grummin, it was only a symbol of corruption now.
Krozan hadn’t used any arcane energy to end the life of his comrade. Krozan’s strength had been enough. Grummin hadn’t even flinched, he had come to expect such brutality from his uncle. Some of the Roden made sounds of terror at such an act. 
One young Roden, who will remain nameless, tried to make a run for the exit. All the exits being at the top tier of the city meant he needed to scurry quickly to try and make it past the assassins. It was hard to follow the Roden’s ascent, he was fast. His heavy breathing and scurrying were the only sounds in the whole city. Everyone seemed to be listening, and hoping that he would make it. If he could escape it would give the Roden a good deal of hope. 
Several wardens walked forward to the edge of the top level. Grummin, along with every Roden who dared look up, could see that there was enough of them to complete a ring around the city, blocking them all from escaping.
When the young Roden finally got close to the top, one of the wardens stepped to mo intercept the Roden. The Roden’s eyes saw only the fury in the warden’s mask, but he charged onward anyway. The only sound was that of the hammer crushing through flesh, bone, and their last bit of hope.
Skeeter was the only other person Grummin could see who was still ready to put up a fight. As the shrieks of the Roden people echoed through the holed city, Grummin quietly spoke to Skeeter, “Is there any other way out of this hole?” Grummin wasn’t sure Skeeter heard him through the panic and he kept his eyes on Krozan who was smiling back at Grummin while cleaning some of the flesh off of his gauntlets.
‘Afraid not.’ Skeeter answered. “Unless you want to brave the chasm.” Grummin nodded. He didn’t plan on finding out how deep into the earth this hole would go. 
Skeeter continued, “You’re not trying to go back on your promise, are you?”
“Just hoping it might still be possible to evacuate.” Grummin took a breath. “So we fight then.” 
Skeeter’s response was simple, but had a profound impact on Grummin, “Aye.”
Krozan, now bored of cleaning his gear, decided to address his disobedient nephew, “So you’ve abandoned your assignment to come here and die among the vermin?” 
Grummin dare not answer, nothing he could say would change his uncle’s mind. He also knew that Krozan wanted to get rid of him. Always sending him on menial tasks and grunt work. Krozan was trying to keep Grummin out of the spotlight. All of this was in hopes to reduce the amount of political power Grummin could attain within the wardens. 
Krozan wasn’t exactly evil. He simply believed all other species were inferior to the Draconians. He only worked with the humans because the wizards were too powerful to overthrow. For now his attention was focused on the Roden. He disregarded all of their unique culture and thought them to be nothing more than disgusting scavengers, little more than rats. 
Krozan lifted his left arm high in the air. It was a signal to the wardens up top and they responded swiftly. Some produced torches others produced canisters sloshing full of oil. At the sight of the black liquid and the fire the panicked Roden all froze.
Krozan kept his hand lifted as he spoke. “I’ll give you one last chance nephew. Leave these rats to us and renounce your rank. Move to the surface and never return. I will let you live.” 
Grummin would have admitted that it was tempting offer but he tried to sound bold and spoke loudly making sure his comrades could hear him, hoping they at least could be swayed, “You are making a mistake uncle! These people have nothing to do with the chimera attacks. This is murder of the innocent.”
Krozan did not speak, he merely dropped his hand. The wardens around the top of the hole began raining oil down onto the Roden homes. Many of the Roden began leaving the safety of their homes and trying to make wild runs for an escape. The several assassins who were still within the hole killed as many as they could. It wasn’t difficult and the bodies began piling up around them. Most put up no fight, focusing solely on escape.
A few Roden did manage to slip by the wardens in the hole, but they were swiftly booted back down by the wardens awaiting them at the top. None were able to escape.
One Roden fell right past where Grummin stood, and down into the chasm. The oil remained mostly on the inside walls, but those walls were already covered and once the fires were lit it would spread throughout city. Grummin noticed all of the flammable goods the Roden had collected and shuddered. 
The wardens up top still held the torches at the ready. Waiting for Krozan’s final signal.
Grummin called out to his uncle, “Stop this madness! Fight me now and let the fate of these people be determined by your metal!” Grummin knew that challenging Krozan would buy them some time. He wouldn’t be able to back down from such a challenge without losing a good deal of respect from his supporters. Grummin knew he was almost as strong as Krozan.
That may have been the case but then Aizen, had come out in an attempt to end the fighting. Aizen slowly walked out of his chamber, against the wishes of many of the Roden inside who were still calling him back into the safety of the building. Grummin didn’t know how safe it would remain when the fire starter, and he suspected Aizen assumed the same.
Aizen strode up slowly to Grummin’s side, wincing occasionally at the pain in his hip. He had a small wooden walking cane, which he needed desperately in order to maintain his balance. Skeeter met him halfway and helped him with the rest of the walk. For a moment the cries of the Roden faded. They adored their chief. No one would want to miss a chance to hear his wisdom, especially if it may be one of the last things they ever hear.
Aizen took a deep breath. And then he took another. And then a few more. Grummin was shocked that Krozan was actually being this patient, but he could see it wouldn’t last. Aizen was now ready, he began to speak, it was louder than any words he had spoken in years, but he wanted and needed to be heard now more than ever before, “My people…” That’s when Krozan shot him in the head.
It wasn’t Krozan specifically who pulled the trigger but rather one of his loyal assassins with a energy rifle. Krozan however did make the call and his hand was still pointing towards Aizen. 
As the old Roden fell to the ground with a charred hole in his head. Skeeter screamed, as did many others. Skeeter caught his chief in his arms. There were no other words from the Roden chief, he was already gone, passing along the great river in the sky.
Skeeter’s pain morphed into rage and it was all directed at a single target. Skeeter rushed forward completely blind to any danger. Grummin tried to stop him but Skeeter moved too quickly. He climbed up and around the walkways in the city, moving faster than he ever has. Skeeter positioned himself on a catwalk slightly above Krozan and sprang into the air with his spear drawn. 
Krozan had the advantage of a clear mind. Skeeter was too mad to think clearly and simply pounced towards his target with all his might. But it wasn’t enough. As Skeeter cleared the distance, Krozan yelled out to his comrades, “Burn it to the ground!” Skeeter barely noticed. He was too focused on his assault to become any more enraged.
Krozan’s defense came swiftly. A backhand swing, similar to the attack on his now beheaded comrade, collided with Skeeter and sent him flying with a good deal of force. Unfortunately for Skeeter the direction was downward, into the chasm.
Grummin watched as Skeeter fell and simultaneously the first torches landed into pools of oil and ignited them. The initial blasts spread the fire around quickly. Grummin had failed, but his challenge hadn’t. 
Krozan leaped down onto the same catwalk where Grummin stood. They were on opposite ends of the catwalk, the distance would be trivial to them both once the fighting began.
Meanwhile the assassins in the hole were leaping out to the safety of the top level. Nearly all the Roden were running around trying to find an escape from the hellish fires. Some tried to reach the top level by climbing the walls. There were still paths which hadn’t been splashed with oil but it funneled them, making them easy targets for the wardens with rifles. Those lucky enough to make it to the top without being shot, were either sliced, smashed, or kicked off back into the hole.
Other Roden tried frantically to dig into the walls. They looked for secret passages that their minds demanded existed. Many fell into the flames, the smell of burning flesh and fur began to fill the air. Some Roden even willingly jumped down into the chasm. 
Grummin could see the joy in his uncle’s face. This was true chaos and Krozan loved every moment of it. Grummin could not wait any longer. He charged all the energy he could muster into his gauntlets. 
Earlier he didn’t have the time to don his chest plate. He was practically naked compared to Krozan’s full plate armour. Krozan lowered his demon mask over his face and also began charging his gear.
With a lack of armour Grummin couldn’t risk being on the defensive. He jumped forward running at near full speed. Krozan took a defensive stance, ready to retaliate. Just prior to entering attack range Grummin punched the ground at his feet releasing a burst of energy and launching himself upward. Krozan was caught off guard for only a moment and quickly found his target. 
Krozan was about to jump up to collide with Grummin in mid air, but when he began flexing for the jump, the ground beneath his feet collapsed. It took Krozan several moments to regain his footing and avoid failing. Those moments were the opening Grummin had hoped for. Grummin prepared a powerful punch.
Krozan swung in defense but was just short of hitting Grummin in the ribs. Whereas Grummin’s punch landed square in Krozan’s face. His punch was amplified by the power coursing through his gauntlets and fortunately it was enough power to break through Krozan’s defense breaking his mask. At the last moment Krozan released some energy from his own armour to send a shockwave. This knocked Grummin back away as Krozan was slammed down into the ground by the force of Grummin’s punch. 
Grummin had been blasted through the solid stone wall of a Roden dwelling at the end of the catwalk.  He was in a small room but the ceiling was surprisingly high. Grummin was able to stand fully upright, although he was very sore.
	He had just a moment to catch his breath before Krozan came blasting through the rest of the wall. Part of the roof collapsed and debris came flying into the room. Krozan’s mask had shattered inward, it made an awful mess of his face and blood dripped down covering the front of his armour. There were small pieces of metal shrapnel lodged into his face. His left eye was covered in blood and looked severely wounded, but in Krozan’s right eye Grummin saw rage. 
The holes in the roof provided pathways for the flaming oil to pour through. This provided a temporary shield for Grummin, as there was no path that Krozan could pass through without getting caught by the oil.
From Grummin’s perspective, this was some kind of living hell. Liquid fire pouring down from the sky, a city in flames, terrified cries of innocent people, and the enraged figure of his murderous uncle standing before him. 
Krozan yelled, “You’ll burn for this, traitor!”
Grummin used this opportunity to poke a little fun at his uncle’s expense, “I think it’s an improvement.” Grummin tried to smile in spite, but it was difficult through his fear. 
His uncle let out a primal scream. For a moment Grummin thought his uncle might just be dumb enough to try to cross the wall of liquid fire. But Grummin was not so lucky. Krozan simply waited patiently for his prey.
He wouldn’t have to wait for much longer. The flow of burning oils was slowing. Grummin took a moment and closed his eyes. He breathed in deeply. A few breaths later, he was calm. The fear remained, but it was now a tool he could use to motivate his body. He was in control, a sharp contrast to Krozan in this moment.
Krozan jumped forward as soon as he saw an opening in the falling oil. But Grummin had the jump on him. Grummin flipped a wooden table up towards his uncle. Krozan halted to shield himself from the projectile. But before the table hit Krozan, Grummin hit the table. 
Krozan tried to shield his last good eye from the wooden shrapnel. However it was Grummin’s fists that dealt him a series of powerful blows. 
Every time Grummin’s fist made contact he released a small burst of energy. Grummin was very strong on his own, he didn’t need to use a ton of magic to do some real damage. Each hit knocked Krozan back another step. Grummin definitely had the advantage but Krozan was keeping up with him, rolling with hit after hit using his armour to absorb most of the blows. But Grummin didn’t let up. Punch after punch after punch. They were now out in the middle of a large catwalk. Grummin went for a large final attack, focusing all of his energy into his fist.
A direct hit right into Krozan’s gut. His plate armour broke open, it couldn’t handle any more damage and Krozan fell to his knees. Grummin felt some pain when the armour cracked but he knew it was no longer his father’s. Krozan began to cough up blood at Grummin’s feet. Grummin had won and was about to take the final blow to end Krozan’s life, but he saw an opportunity to ask a question. 
“Why do this? Why go against my father’s ideals?” The city around them was quietly burning, all signs of Roden life had been extinguished. The only movement now was the dancing of the flames around them. 
Krozan looked up at Grummin, as he wiped some of the blood from his mouth. “Your father was a fool. These creatures are but pests.”
“You’re wrong.” Grummin knew there would be no reasoning.
As Grummin began pulling back for his attack Krozan spoke four small words that stunned Grummin, “I killed your father.” 
The hesitation was enough time for Krozan to lift his arm and release a huge blast of energy towards Grummin. The blast knocked Grummin back along the catwalk. Krozan had released nearly all his energy in one single blast. It was intensely powerful. Grummin hit the ground rolled right off the edge of the catwalk, barely catching the ledge.
As Grummin held on with a single hand he looked around and saw that there were no other catwalks below him. The only thing below him was darkness. Even with all the new light from the fires the drop still appeared bottomless. He thought about swinging over to the nearest wall, but it was covered in flames. 
Krozan was standing above him on the catwalk. His one eye was nearly shut and covered in blood. He slowly placed a heavy boot on top of Grummin’s hand. He twisted his boot ever so slightly onto Grummin’s fingers. Grummin had so many questions, that he barely felt the pain.
Krozan began speaking, in a tone that was victorious and showed he was very pleased with himself, “You might be thinking that there’s no way it could be true. Your father died of natural causes, of course. Just another one of your uncle’s dirty tricks.” 
Grummin was losing his grip. His fingers were being crushed. Krozan’s foot was the only thing holding him up at this point and Krozan knew it.
Krozan pushed just a little bit harder onto Grummin’s hand as he spoke, “I did kill your father. I poisoned him, slowly over the years, to make it look natural.” 
Grummin’s mind was not ready for this. He began to thrash about, Krozan was caught off guard and laughingly said, “Watch out Grum, we wouldn’t want you falling just yet, I have so much more to tell you.” 
Grummin wasn’t listening, he was simply trying to break free from this man, he would hear no more of his vile words. Krozan spoke on, “Don’t you want to know what happened to your mother?”
Grummin made a final thrash. It was enough to slip his hand out from beneath Krozan’s foot ripping off a couple fingers in the process. As Grummin fell backwards into the chasm he lifted his good hand and made a gesture, which in Draconian culture meant, see you in hell.
This angered Krozan immensely.

            <Title>Surges Of Pain</Title>
            <Text>Back in Ren's workshop Umbra’s consciousness slowly returned to her body. The afternoon light burst through the windows and directly into the slits in her eyes. The pain had subsided to a low rumble in her left side. She lifted her hand to block the light. The brightness rattled around in her mind, given her a throbbing headache. Her other hand reached down to feel her wound.
The blood in her clothes was dry, but the wound was still fresh. A metallic scent filled her nostrils. It reminded Umbra of the previous night. Suddenly two fears sprung through her body. Umbra reached for her throat and discovered that her newly acquired accessory was still around her neck. The jerking motion had ignited the pain, but the golden necklace was there and that was a relief.
Umbra’s second fear was that she had slept much too long in this workshop and the owner might return any moment. She tried to move but she could barely sit up on her own. That’s when the idea hit her. An idea that can easily be argued to have come from a place of reason, but in fact it gave from a much darker place in Umbra’s mind.
The Dust that Jak had given her was strong stuff. Jak had warned that it was a potent substance, ready to take over any weak willed individual courageous enough to partake. But Jak believed Umbra was strong of will. He wasn’t wrong, these things are just a matter of degree. Desperation to return to Jak was driving Umbra’s willpower way down. 
As the fear began to take over Umbra’s mind the thought that the Dust provided a potential solution became stronger. Umbra didn’t bother thinking out the details and assumed that the enhanced senses could provide the extra boost she needed to start moving again.
She felt pretty damn low right now and anything that might help would be welcome. She fiddled slowly through her pockets, each movement causing her to wince at her pain. After a few more seconds she found the small pouch of Dust, she was thankful it didn’t take longer.
There was little hesitation. She took a large pinch of Dust and dropped it into her mouth. It was a messy process and caused a good deal of coughing. This made her wound ache even louder, but then she began to feel the Dust kicking in. Fast acting as guaranteed. Umbra’s mind calmed for moment with the relief. 
Just as she began to relax the pain returned more violently than before. She wasn’t expecting her heightened senses to worsen the pain. It raged into a fire of sharp needles. The pain began spreading. She could feel every small bruise and tiny scratch screaming out in agony. Her major wound seemed to be rejecting the very idea of existence. Luckily the pain was so intense that Umbra fainted from the extreme stimuli. But not before writhing in the sensations for what felt to her as several hours. It was actually about a minute, but the mind has a funny way of altering the perception of time, usually opposed to the perceivers desires. 
Before she finally passed out, Umbra had managed to vomit a good deal of blood all over the couch she laid on. Ren would have a hell of a time cleaning out the stains.

            <Title>Save The Pit</Title>
            <Text>Grummin knew these tunnels well, better than most. From the scratches on the brickwork to the smells in the air. It didn’t take him long to reach his destination. From what he gathered, Grummin believed that his uncle had sent a stealth team to exterminate the Roden and he hoped he wasn’t too late to prevent it.
Grummin also believed that diplomacy could bring about true peace. They already had a treaty and talks were going well up until the chimeras showed up. Grummin needed to convince the chief of the Roden to cease his assault and get his uncle to do the same. He didn’t know which would be more difficult.
This entrance to the Roden city was what you could call the main entrance. It had been carved away out of the rock and looked more like a cave mouth than a part of the original tunnel structure. There were many entrances to the Roden undercity but this was one of the few that a full grown Draconian could walk through, albeit crouching a little bit. 
The gate itself was a makeshift doorway, crafted from all sorts of old lumber, driftwood, metal pipes, plastic flaps, among other scavenged materials. At first glance you might mistake this gate for a pile of debris. But the experienced eye could see that there were several openings in the gate. These opening were about the the size of the average full grown Roden, which was about a quarter the size of a Draconian. 
Although you shouldn’t let their size fool you. The Roden were cunning and fast. When they out numbered you, it was a dangerous spot to be in, even for a Draconian warden. But nonetheless Grummin marched up to the front gate and knocked.
Judging by the lack of commotion inside the city, Grummin assumed Petra’s distraction had worked and he’d made here it before Krozan. He could just barely hear the little voices whispering on the inside of the gate. The Roden guards stationed at the gate were especially suspicious and usually didn’t show themselves unless necessary. A Draconian showing up alone at their front door was odd enough. That same Draconian knocking instead of smashing through the door was absurd. They needed to discuss it before reacting.
Finally after a few moments, a Roden pushed his head through one of the latches to get a look at Grummin. They made eye contact for just a moment, then suddenly he pulled his head back in and Grummin could hear the next round of whispering. He thought it a good time to speak up, “I come with intentions of peace and a warning to all your people.”
The whispering stopped as he spoke. A voice spoke from the other side, “ There is no peace with you brutes! Leave now or else we will be forced to attack.”
Grummin knew this would be difficult but he needed to speak to their leader. “I mean no harm. I seek an audience with the chief.” There was no response. He needed to hurry. “Your families are in great danger.” 
Still no response, but he could hear them whispering. Most likely deciding whether or not to release their chimera beasts Grummin assumed. In fact Grummin was quite surprised that they hadn’t already sent out some chimeras. 
He needed to prove himself to them. Roden, like Draconians, valued actions over words. So Grummin took a deep breathe. “Please, I’m trying to save you, my father wanted to live peacefully with all the creatures under the city.” As he spoke Grummin began to remove his bracers. Then the rest of his armour. This action would be understood universally by any creature capable of using weapons. Grummin was prepared to offer his life to speak with their chief. Throwing all of his goods to the ground, feeling quite naked without his armour, he got on his knees and pleaded one final time. “Please! There isn’t much time.”
There was another pause, no immediate response. But there was no whispering either. Grummin kept his head bowed and low to the ground. He was just about ready to give up when he heard a heavy bolt slide back behind the gate. Then the whole gate slowly swung open. Grummin wasn’t entirely sure that large makeshift door could open. It was possible that only the small latches would open and that he’d have to squeeze through. But Grummin was pleased when he saw that it did indeed open to accommodate someone of his size.
A Roden with orange fur, small even for their standards, stuck his head out of the door. He held a small spear made from a broken dagger and a metal pipe. He kept the spear at his side and at the ready. He spoke, and Grummin could hear the fear in his throat, “Look me in the eye, Draconian.”
This request was common among many cultures. It was believed that one would have a very difficult time lying, during intentional eye contact. Asking someone to repeat themselves while looking you in the eye was seen as a way to begin an open dialog. To establish trust. 
There was no direct proof that the eye contact principle worked, and in fact there were many who’ve mastered lying techniques that could easily overcome the eye contact test. But this was more of a social contract, like a promise. Lying after being asked to look into someone's eyes was considered powerfully disrespectful. Some cultures would even kill for such a betrayal. The Roden were one of those cultures.
Grummin lifted his head slowly and made eye contact as requested. Grummin’s gaze was fiercely serious and it was almost too much for the Roden, but he maintained his eye contact as well. 
“You are all in grave danger.” They’re eyes remained in contact for some time. 
The Roden nodded and acknowledged Grummin’s determination. He turned his head back and signaled his allies. Several more emerged from behind the gate, all of which had some sort of makeshift weapon similar to the spear.
The orange haired Roden spoke again, “No quick moves, come with us.” Several Roden surrounded him with their weapons drawn. A few others grabbed his gear and carried it in. It took more than one just to lift each piece of armour. 
Grummin slowly got to his feet and followed them through the gate.
The Roden city was much larger than Grummin had imagined. He thought that the stealth team might actually have their hands full trying to exterminate the entire city. The city itself was a huge cavity in the earth. The center of which was simply a giant hole dug out of the ground. Surrounding the hole was a large circular plateau. Many structures aligned the walls on the plateau, most of which appeared to be some kind of barracks or soldier outpost. There were also several tunnels around the circumference of the city similar to the one he had arrived through, Grummin assumed it was the other exits. He feared that any moment a group of his warden brothers might crash though and begin the extermination. He prayed there was enough time.
They approached the massive hole. There were several paths leading down and around the hole. Cross beams, like catwalks, were scattered through the hole connecting one side to the other. The buildings were mostly carved out of the rocks. Many were still half covered by natural stone.
Looking down Grummin could see the Roden were busy scurrying across with jugs, packs, and tools. Most of these Roden were stunned to see him there, although they didn’t appear to be afraid. Likely because he was surrounded by a dozen guards, that would keep the Roden calm. But it didn’t stop them from staring, and most went clear out of their way to avoid crossing paths with him.  
The dozen Roden that surrounded him were all keeping a strict eye on him as they marched downward and deeper into the hole. They occasionally gave him a small warning. Either verbally or using the sharp ends of their weapons against his backside. This didn’t help Grummin’s balance. The walk ways weren’t meant for someone of his size. He had to be extra cautious with his footing. A slip up here would mean he’d go fumbling down into the depths of the hole. That wasn’t an appealing event for many reasons. Not the least of which was that Grummin still hadn’t received any visual confirmation that the hole had a bottom.
There was a good deal of fire light in the upper areas of the city. However down in the lower area, light seemed to be getting scarce. Except for a few glowing windows, the paths he was being led down were mostly dark. That wouldn’t bother the Roden for their vision in the dark was nearly as good as a human’s vision on a bright day. Draconians fell somewhere in between, working best in low light, but in the complete dark Grummin would be just as lost as a human.
Grummin was getting nervous. Not much was known about the Roden culture. It did however seem odd that their chief would be living in the lower parts of the city. This was completely counter intuitive compared to most leaders that Grummin had read about. They usually preferred to be seated high above everyone else in a show of superiority. 
Grummin wondered how much farther the down this hole he’d have to travel before he could see the chief. In his urgency, Grummin began to fear that he wasn’t being led to the chief at all. He tried to remove the thought from his mind, he’d shared a promise with the orange Roden that led them now.
Grummin decided to ask if they were close, but just before he asked the orange Roden spoke.
“Here we are. Our leader is inside, greet him with respect or else you’ll never leave this hole, lizard.”
The slur had hurt Grummin, Draconians were proud of their ancestry. Being simplified to a animal was very insulting and he felt compassion for the Roden who were often mocked as being no more than mere rats. 
When his attention returned to their destination Grummin was shocked. The building that stood before him was no different than the rest, in fact it looked a little run down compared to its nearest neighbours. This didn’t do a lot for Grummin’s confidence. Last chance for him to make a run for it. But he couldn’t bring himself to do that now. He told himself that his father wouldn’t have run, and neither will he, no matter the consequences.
Grummin was ushered in by the same Roden who had vouched for him at the gate. He hadn’t learned this Roden’s name, however Grummin thought him to be a clever one, perhaps a leader in his community. 
A curtain that was being used as a door was lifted away. Thankfully this doorway was huge by Roden standards so Grummin needed only to bend down a bit to get through. The orange-haired Roden followed him into the building while the rest of them remained outside with his armour.
The Roden weren’t foolish enough to bring the Draconian’s weapons into their leader’s chambers with him. Besides the Roden were curious creatures. Tinkerers by nature, they loved to mess around with newer technology whenever they got a chance. 
The inside of the chief’s chambers were rather large. It was much bigger than it appeared on the outside. The inside had been carved out to create a huge chamber. This made a bit more sense to Grummin, the outside was sort of an illusion. Invaders would have a hard time locating the chief’s home among the hundreds of other buildings. 
Inside the chief’s chamber, there were few dozen Roden inside. Many of which were sitting up on higher tiers along the walls. The room was build like a large atrium, there were several cascading levels along every wall except the one with the door way he’d come through. The walls weren’t exactly straight or even but Grummin could tell the Roden had put a lot of extra work into them. 
Some were drinking, others looked to be playing some kind of dice game. All of them looked to be having a good time until Grummin walked in. A silence fell upon the room. It was so sudden it was startling. All the Roden were in synchronicity, turning their heads towards him in unison.
On the far side of the room opposite to Grummin, there was a throne of sorts. It wasn’t a fancy sort of chair, like one that you could see in old paintings of human Kings long past. The biggest difference was that it looked comfortable. The Roden sitting on it had to be the oldest that Grummin had ever laid eyes on. The fur on his scalp was thin and his beard was almost completely white, and it was quite long. His fur was a soft grey, not from age, but simply in colour. He wore a large pair of glasses, likely something found in the trash. The glasses looked much too big for his face and was likely a pair made for a human. But somehow it suited him. It made him appear wise. 
Most Draconians didn’t live to be very old. Many died in the line of battle, well before time could steal away their youth. With the exception of Grummin’s own father, he had very little experience with the elderly. But he did notice a few things about the Roden chief. 
First of all, he sat in a way that showed he was uncomfortable. Or rather that this awkward position was the most comfortable position he had. Sort of a best of the worst kind of posture. Bezelnorf was the same in the months before he passed. Once he found that position it was very unlikely that he’d move out of it for some time. 
The orange Roden that led Grummin made the introduction, “Welcome Draconian. This is our chief, He Who Leads The Roden, Lord Aizen.”
The Roden chief was facing to the side, he had been speaking to another, likely an adviser of some kind. So when he turned only his neck to face Grummin, instead of his whole body, Grummin could see the pain although he hid it well. This also explained his throne. It was covered in pillows and other soft materials. 
The Roden chief examined Grummin for a while, then slowly thought of how he wished to greet this unexpected guest. He smiled, a pleasing sight to Grummin, then spoke softly barely more than a whisper, but in this profound silence it rang loud, “Welcome Grummin Irontooth, son of Bezelnorf, the Great Pacifist.” 
Grummin was stunned. He had mentally prepared a respectful greeting but all that had been lost. The only thing that came out of his mouth was breath as he silently opened and closed his mouth.
The chief smiled a mischievous smile, he had wanted to shock him. He reveled in his success for a few moments and then continued, “We have been expecting you, Grummin. You’re father foretold that you’d one day come to us.”
Grummin was finally able to say something, “You knew my father?” Grummin was still crouched. If he stood straight up he’d likely hit his head, although the ceilings were tall enough that he could stand if he remained bent slightly.
The orange haired Roden was angered by Grummin’s lack of respect. He stepped forward and grabbed Grummin’s shoulder. The grip was much stronger than Grummin would have expected. 
He spoke standing up straight so they were nearly face to face, “Show some respect.” As the Roden spoke many of his kin sitting around the room mumbled in agreement. The low murmur continued for a few moments until Grummin regained his composure. They were right, he needed to focus and present himself as the emissary he was trying to portray. He had gotten this far, now was not the time to screw it up.
Grummin bowed down trying to look as respectful as possible. Aizen spoke once more and it silenced the room, “Skeeter, He Who Dances With Trash, there is no need to be foul to our guest.” The room hung off of every one of Aizen’s words. Grummin made note of the orange haired Roden’s name, wondering how they had decided upon that particular name.
Skeeter let go of Grummin and backed off. He lowered his head towards his King and said, “I’m sorry my lord.” He then stepped back into the crowd, but Grummin could feel Skeeter’s eyes constantly watching him. Skeeter wasn't convinced that this Draconian should be trusted simply because he was the son of Bezelnorf.
Aizen, the chief, began to speak once more, “Grummin, please take a seat.” Grummin looked around at the few tiny chairs in the room. He felt confused, did he really expect him to fit into one of those chairs. But suddenly there was a tapping on his back. Grummin looked behind him. There was a young Roden behind him. She was very shy as she presented a large cushion on the ground behind him. Grummin thanked her and she scuttled off without saying a word.
Grummin sat down, he had a moment to calm his mind and organize his thoughts. Aizen gave him the time he needed then he continued when he felt Grummin was ready, “Grummin, you have come bearing a great warning have you not?”
Grummin responded with urgency, “Yes your Majesty.” Grummin wasn’t sure how to formally address the chief just yet.
Aizen responded, “Call me Aizen. You are an honoured guest. Your father foretold of a such dangers and that you’d be the one to come to our aid.”
“Yes... Uh Aizen.” Grummin wanted to ask so many questions about this father. But now was not the time, “I believe there is currently an elite assassination team on their way to your city.” This claim caused a commotion in the audience. They began to speak amongst themselves. 
“How can you assume we’d believe you?” Skeeter accused from behind Grummin.
“Skeeter.” Aizen gave his kin a stern look and Skeeter turned away. “We feared this day. What can we do Grummin?”
Grummin was a little taken aback by the King’s question, surprised that his opinion was in demand, it was an unusual event, “I think we should evacuate the city. I can try to convince the wardens to stop their attacks. But you’ll need to call off your chimeras immediately.” At the mention of the chimeras another round of discussion sparked in the audience.
Aizen responded curiously, “We have control over no such creatures. It is not in our nature to use such dark magic nor do we condone the warping of nature into those abominations.” 
This didn’t make any sense to Grummin, “Then where did the beasts come from, they attacked us from this direction.”
“The witch.” The king spoke with a fierce sureness. “She is the only one among us who would tinker with such things.”
“Then can’t you order her to stop.” Grummin wasn’t sure about how the power system worked in the Roden culture.
“My people do not respond to orders, we live by a code of respect. Corina has never shown me any respect. And as such she does not choose to live among us in the city.” The chief spoke not out of hatred or fear, but out of sadness. “She wanted to send enough of these creatures to annihilate all of the Draconian wardens. I refused, she was furious and tried to attack me. Claiming that I was a weak.” Aizen chuckled and continued, “She was right. I am weak, I cannot protect me people any longer. I’m too old to fight.” 
Skeeter jumped in, “You are still strong my lord. You have led our people to a prosperous time.” 
The King smiled at Skeeter. It was a smile that said thank you for your kindness, even though you are mistaken. He responded to Skeeter, but he spoke towards Grummin, “During my rule countless Roden have fallen, I have yet to bring any lasting peace to my people.”
“So you’re saying that this witch, Corina, is the source of these chimeras and you also want peace in the tunnels?” Grummin confirmed.
“Indeed, we wish to stop the bloodshed. But we must also protect our own when threatened.” Aizen spoke firmly but then paused for a moment to catch his breath. “Old age is catching up with me.” Another short pause, “Perhaps now, with you Grummin, we will be able to put an end to this fighting and begin talks of true peace.”
Grummin’s heart was bursting with excitement. He came into the Roden territory expecting resistance and a fight. He instead found similar opinions to his own and from their leader no less. In a way he felt more at home here now then he did among his Draconian kin. 
“Now we simply need to explain the situation to my uncle and we can stop all this madness.” Grummin spoke optimistically.
The King didn’t look so hopeful, “You wardens have not previously been interested in talks of peace. Not since Bezelnorf passed along the great river in the sky.” A shirt pause. “Your father and I engaged in many meetings and shared a good few laughs in my younger days.”
Grummin agreed with Aizen's observation of the Draconians. “You’re right, we may still need to evacuate. Then I can act as a diplomat and we can establish a dialog between our people.” 
There was some discussion among the Roden, but the general tone felt positive. It was clear now that Grummin’s eyes were adjusted to the light that many of the Roden here were women and children. Quite possibly the chief’s many offspring. Grummin looked around, he saw scared people, and he wondered how some many of his kin could have such racial hatred. It would be hard to convince his uncle, Grummin knew it would likely end with a fight.
Grummin took a deep breath, “We need to start evacuating now. It won’t be long before the wardens arrive. How quickly can we get your people to safety?”
Aizen paused for a moment, in thought, “It may take some time to gather together, but even still, where would you have us go, this is our home?” 
Grummin didn’t know where they could go. They would have to move outward from the center of the tunnels. But the outer tunnels still had many feral creatures dwelling within them. Grummin couldn’t lead women and children into the mouths of monsters.
Grummin decided, “Then our only course of action is to stop their attack here. We’ll need any and all fighters you have ready at the entrances. When the assassins arrive they will be quick. We must be ready at all points of entry.”
Aizen thought about this tactic, “You may be right. Will you lead our soldiers Grummin?” 
Grummin was honoured. In five minutes with the Roden he had already become a leader. He’d been with the wardens for years now and was still no higher rank than new recruits.
“Yes.I can do that. I will protect your people.” Grummin could tell there was some unrest about this statement. So he added, “And I swear on my father’s grave, I will bring peace to these tunnels!” 
With that there were a few cheers in the room. The Roden began to rally around Grummin when suddenly and very high pitched squeal came from outside. It was the sound of a Roden screaming and then it was suddenly cut short.

            <Title>BugBot's Adventure Vol.1</Title>
            <Text>Back at Ren's office, the small metal creature known as BugBot was wreaking havoc throughout the building. Ren's boss Stephen, his lackey Carson, and a few other wizards have been chasing this little guy for nearly an hour. 
BugBot mission was twofold; collect data and don’t get caught. The wooden machinery that made up the bulk of BugBot’s frame was very intricate. BugBot was the third generation of Beedel’s design. The first two generations failed their first missions, ending in destruction for the little creatures. 
At this point BugBot’s pursuers were beginning to keep up to his movements. Much of the upper floors of the office had been scorched from their fire blasts. Now near the lower floors, another round of hide and seek had begun. 
BugBot’s immediate goal was to escape to the tunnels. With all the commotion it would be near impossible for BugBot to hook up to the network as planned. 
For the moment it was quiet. BugBot had chewed through the floor to get to the lower levels of the building. However BugBot knew chewing would take too long against the thick concrete between the basement and ground floor that it was on now. 
Just as BugBot was formulating a new plan, Stephen and Carson came bursting through the ceiling. It seemed they found the small hole BugBot had made and choose to create their own bigger hole to save time. BugBot had to move quickly to avoid being crushed. Thankfully moving quickly was one of BugBot’s strengths. He swiftly dodged all the oncoming debris and began to scurry away hoping to avoid being spotted.
Unfortunately, mid fall, Carson’s keen eye noticed the dark wood of BugBot’s limbs zoom across the floor. Carson shouted to Stephen, “Found the little bastard!” 
Once they’d landed Carson pointed out his finger gun, ready to shoot. BugBot hadn’t found proper cover and was unprepared to dodge the blast. It would have hit him if Stephen hadn’t suddenly got up and pushed Carson out of his way. Carson was knocked over and his fire blast went shooting towards the the back wall of the room. Thr blasts were growing larger as BugBot’s pursuers grew more frustrated. Their concern for the well being of the building was diminishing quickly.
BugBot scuttled around while calculating his escape path. His small red eye laid upon the door to the lift. The doors themselves weren’t that strong and the lift would most definitely have access to the tunnels, it was decided, but how to open them. BugBot’s circuitry ran for a few more cycles and then it formed its plan. 
Meanwhile both Stephen and Carson had resumed hunting. Their hands, and spells, were at the ready. Some of the wizards of this floor watched with curiosity, others try to ignore the noise and continue their work.
BugBot was cornered, the elevator was behind his enemies. He slowly approached his pursuers hoping to sneak through their legs. But again Carson spotted him and called out to Stephen who pulled his attention towards BugBot. 
There was a short standoff between the three of them. BugBot stood motionless on it’s six thin legs. Stephen and Carson each pointed their fingers slightly to the side of BugBot covering him from escaping to either side.
As soon as BugBot started to move, both Stephen and Carson began shooting. It was blast after blast, but each one missed, BugBot had thrown them off by charging straight ahead.
As BugBot approach the two wizards, he scurried up some of the debris and jumped through the gap between them. The trajectory was well calculated and would place BugBot almost exactly in front of the lift doors.
Neither wizard stopped blasting. They followed his path through the air. Each blast always just slightly behind the wooden creature. It was almost too late when Carson realized that BugBot’s trajectory would place the creature directly between himself and Stephen. Carson was able to stop shooting and he tried to duck out of the way as Stephen continued blasting. But Stephen was rage blind and didn’t even notice when he sent Carson flying into the nearby cubicles his clothes aflame. 
Even after torching Carson, Stephen continued blasting after BugBot. One of Stephen’s final fire blasts had hit the lift door and created a small opening that BugBot could take advantage of, without hesitation he scurried inside the hole, tearing at it slightly to make it fit.
Stephen finally realized that he’d just fallen into a trap and cursed, “Fucking bot!”
BugBot scurried on it’s merry way down the shaft of the lift. It’s goal now to get far away from the pursuers and reunite with Beedel. BugBot also considered trying to find another terminal to connect to, maybe it could still get some information to please it’s creator.

            <Title>Old Bonds</Title>
            <Text>The lift doors opened to the tunnels and the first thing Ren saw was a familiar face covered in blood.
“Hello Ren.” The warden said. The voice did not yet have that raspy quality that all Draconians acquired in their manhood. It was hard to tell by looking at his face, but this Draconian was young. Barely a teenager by Draconian standards.
“Hello Grummin, long time.” Ren knew this Draconian. Grummin's father Bezelnorf had been the first warden.
Seeing Grummin after so long reminded Ren of the times when his father would have Bezelnorf over as a guest in their home. Silver had also been widely known for his fighting ability. When Bezelnorf wasn’t single handedly fighting off the monsters down in the tunnels, it was Silver who stood beside him.
The day before Ren's father left, Bezelnorf had come to the house. Grummin was with him, but Grummin was still a small baby at the time. Even as a baby Grummin’s tusks were impressive. The three of them went into the workshop together but Ren wasn’t allowed to follow. He had wanted to observe the little Draconian baby some more. Ren was a child at the time and had he known it would be the last day with his father he might have done things differently.
Ever since then Bezelnorf had occasionally looked after Ren. Grummin grew up with Ren as an older brother. They hadn’t seen each other much lately, but seeing Grummin now, so suddenly, brought back a lot of painful memories. Although Ren was also relieved. He missed Grummin’s odd charm.
Grummin smiled, “Brother, I’ve missed you.” As the smile morphed into a mischievous smirk, Grummin lifted a pair of shackles. Ren wasn’t phased, this was protocol after all. 
Whenever a Wizard was sent through the tunnels to a Commissioner, it commonly meant they were being expelled from the association. It wasn’t uncommon for many wizards to flee during the trip, stealing association technology when they did.
“I’m ready. Let’s get this over with.” Ren offered his wrists.
“Drop the game Ren. There’s no cameras down here. We can leave them off until we get to close to the Tower.” 
“Grum,” Ren inquired, “Why is it that you’re the one escorting me?” The higher ups knew about their relationship so Ren was curious why they had arranged this, they usually tried to avoid mixing family with any task, no matter how simple. 
“We’ve been busy like hell down here.” Grummin’s voice was starting to get impatient. He signaled Ren to step out of the lift. Ren did so and they continued their chat while they walked.
“I can see that. You look… busy.” Ren tried to speak authoritatively, as an older brother should. But he was also legitimately afraid of Grummin’s ferocity and made pains to avoid disrespecting him. Ren had seen Grummin snap on a couple of occasions. All the calm would leave Grummin faster than you could apologize, and then you’d be dealing with his fists.
“Yeah, it’s been a few days. Seems the Roden have taken a liking to chimerism.” Grummin replied.
“They broke the treaty?” Ren asked.
“I’m not sure.”
“Are we in danger?” Ren dreaded the idea of encountering a Frankenstein beast which contained all the worse portions of all his different nightmares.
“Shouldn’t be. I just did another sweep of this area. Cleared out the last couple stragglers as I came to pick you up. But most of the fighting is aimed directly at our headquarters.” Grummin’s confidence was a welcome change for Ren, however it didn’t quite soothe him. Every 20 meters or so they passed by another corridor and there was no way Grummin had efficiently checked each possible hiding hole in the area. Ren wished he had his gun.
“Great.” Ren's lack of faith was transparent.
“It’s alright Ren, even if I missed one or two, they’re just tiny creatures. I can take care of it.” Grummin sometimes acted more like the big brother. Draconians grew up quick, they needed to, or else they didn’t survive their family’s training regime. That went triple for the son of the first warden. 
Grummin continued to explain the situation, unaware that the story would only make Ren's fears grow, “The problem began as hundreds of these little fuckers started swarming the tunnels. It took us hours to stop them the first time. But wave after wave continued to show up. It’s been three days.” Grummin paused, thinking. Then he continued, “I overheard Krozan and some seniors talking about an assault on the Roden. I’m nervous Ren.”
“An extermination?” The words had jumped out of Ren's mouth. It was delicate topic. Grummin looked up to meet Ren's eyes and stopped walking. Ren took a couple more steps before stopping as well. Grummin’s eyes were full of sadness.
“Not if I can help it.” Ren grasped Grummin’s impatience. Although he was one of the most skilled wardens, Grummin was still low on the warden’s political ladder. His ideas and opinions were still disrespected. That’s how things worked in the wardens. Being the son of the founder gave him no advantage. 
After Grummin’s father passed away it was his younger brother Krozan who took over control of the wardens. Bezelnorf had lived for many years beyond what was expected of the average Draconian. Throwing himself into the fray of battle daily, it was a surprise when the beast that finally took him down, was a simple virus.
Ren had to ask, “So they sent you to pick me up to keep you out of their way?” 
It was a difficult question for Grummin to answer, “Yes, Ren. So if you don’t mind I’d like to hurry.” Ren got the hint and upped his speed. Grummin matched his pace.
“So why are you being commissioned?” Grummin asked.
“I’m not too sure.” Ren replied.
Grummin cocked an eyebrow, “Really? Sure you weren’t pissing someone off.”
“Not this time, but I do think a coworker has it out for me.”
“So this should be a quick meeting then?”
“Don’t know Grum.” Ren shrugged. “Let’s hope it’s not too quick.”
“Yeah.” Grummin’s attention was leaving their conversation.
Ren tried to force a laugh and wished that his meeting would be a simple reprimand and nothing more. The silence grew over them as they walked through the tunnels.
The wardens were almost entirely ranked full of Draconians. It was a rarity that any other species even wanted to join the wardens and even many Draconians chose the easy life on the surface. The wardens spent almost all their hours underground fighting all sorts of bizarre creatures. It was a rough life, and Draconians made up some of the toughest people. Still it was only the toughest among them who joined the ranks of warden.
In the past, Bezelnorf primarily used fear tactics in order to scare off all the unwanted creatures that called the tunnels home. He would only ever kill if there was no other option. Eventually as the wardens grew it became too large an organization for Bezelnorf to control on his own. His brother, Krozan volunteered to help him lead, along with a few others of their kin.
As is the case with any organized group of people, there were power struggles and differences in opinion. Bezelnorf wished to continue using scare tactics to avoid serious conflicts. Where as many of the other leaders wanted to act more aggressively, driving out the scum once and for all. As time went on Bezelnorf lost control and more leaders kept siding with the aggressive mindset. 
One night, without Bezelnorf’s consent the other leaders planned a campaign to end the fighting once and for all. They infiltrated the occupied parts of the tunnels and slaughtered every living thing they could find. Bezelnorf was devastated. 
What Bezelnorf understood was that it was they who were the invaders. Many species had made homes in these tunnels for decades. They were simply defending their homes. Bezelnorf also understood that the tunnels went far beyond the need of the Wizard Association so his tactic was to simply push the creatures outward where they could live happily while the wizards made use of the tunnels nearer to the city center. The other leaders didn’t see it that way. They saw the tunnel’s residents as pests to be exterminated. 
After that massacre the creatures of the tunnels began deliberately hunting out the wardens. The tunnels were a war zone for years. But all that was well before Ren and Grummin’s time. Now the fights had subsided. The warden forces have regrown significantly. The tunnels were the safest they’ve ever been. 
Ren and Grummin walked silently for a great time. Both thinking of something to say but then dropping it, feeling the awkwardness of the emotional distance between them.
Grummin was of the same opinion as his father. That they had no right to destroy an entire species simply because they wanted the tunnels for themselves.
As Bezelnorf lay in bed, near death, he whispered his dying wish into  Grummin’s ear. Ren was there, as were many of the Irontooth clan. Bezelnorf had a large family, but only one son. Grummin was Bezelnorf’s shining star. Ren didn’t get to hear what Bezelnorf said, but the passion was strong in Grummin from that day forth. Ren always assumed Bezelnorf said something like; stop the killings, or save the children. Whatever it was, Ren was sure it was something dramatic, as that was Bezelnorf’s way of speaking. Especially considering it was his last words, anything else would have be anticlimactic. Bezelnorf would have none of that.
Grummin never shared those final words with anyone. But after that day he joined the wardens and began speaking out to end the fighting. Assured that there could be peace in the tunnels. He’s worked tirelessly to bring a better understanding to not only the leaders but all wardens. Here’s received a good deal of push back for it as well. Especially from his uncle Krozan. 
Krozan uses guised language to hide the fact that he simply enjoys the killing. Krozan could care less about the rights of Roden or other creatures. Krozan was also the main force holding Grummin down the political ladder. Bezelnorf was loved and respected, once his son gained power Krozan knew things would eventually go Grummin’s way. Grummin had a confident charisma that helped people see his side of things. Many wardens also believed Grummin was morally right. But due to fear of ridicule, most kept their mouths shut and did as they were told. 
At this point Ren and Grummin had been walking for nearly 15 minutes in silence. Ren wasn’t exactly sure how long it would take to get to the Wizard Tower, he had never gone there through the tunnels. They had taken several turns along the way. Ren thought himself good with directions but down here none of that mattered. The complex geometry and pathways which split off at obscure angles made things very hazy. 
Ren often wondered if there was any spatial warping going on down here. Somehow you always managed to get to where you needed to go faster than if you traveled there using the surface streets. It could be due to the lack of traffic and crowds. Avoiding those was a benefit own it’s own, but somehow the zigzagged tunnels still got you there much faster than expected.
Ren was sufficiently lost and the silence had been sufficiently long. He thought he’d try to strike up conversation. After all this was his brother in bond who he hadn’t seen in several moons. “So Grum, have you tried…” 
Ren was cut off by a loud crashing sound coming from a nearby split off. Grummin took a defensive stance, “Ren, stay behind me.” Grummin wore very little armour. Some loose padded leather covered most of his vital spots. His power armour only covered his chest, and shoulders. He also wore heavy metal boots and very similar metal arm bracers. All of his armour pieces were made from the same high grade steel and they all shared similar markings. Flat black stripes swirled  up and down the armour. 
Ren recognized that these stripes were the channels for energizing power armour, he had seen similar marking on Beedel’s armour. Grummin flicked both his arms out to either side of him. The action snapped his bracers into action and they slid down his arms and formed into a pair of gauntlets. As the gauntlets snapped and clanged together, Grummin took his stance. It was low and animalistic. Grummin was a brawler, he didn’t use any magic except that which was used by his armour. Any armour that was worth a damn these days had some form of magical enhancement. Ren also grabbed his Crystal and loaded a few rudimentary spells. Just in case. 
The pressure in the room was shifting. This surprised Ren, but Grummin didn’t seem to notice. His eyes were transfixed unto the doorway, ready for whatever might come through. The majority of the tunnels had more than a few newly installed power pipes running along the walls and ceiling. These pipes swirled with colour. Most of these pipes were no wider than a bottle of wine, but there were several going to and coming from each hallway they had passed. The power pipes added some well needed lighting. Without the alternating colours emitted by the pipes these tunnels would be pitch black and much more ominous.
The change in pressure was likely caused by a crack in one of the pipes. When these pipes broke it created a sort of energy draft. Ren could feel the pressure coming from the same hallway that Grummin was fixated onto. He thought a small warning might benefit Grummin in case that crack got worse. Just before he found the words, Ren could swear he heard voices from that hallway. When he looked at Grummin he could tell that Grummin heard them too.
That’s when the pressure got a whole lot worse. Ren called out to Grummin to get back, but before he could the pipe burst. Colourful energy blasted from the hallway. Smoke, rubble, and discharge followed it. Ren got knocked down by the blast. He wasn’t hurt, but he was on his ass. Grummin however was still standing.
As the flames and smoke dispersed, another figure emerged from the hall. Ren was stunned to see a familiar set of armour flailing it’s arms at the smoke. The face plate was open on the armour and Ren could identify it was indeed Beedel. The sought from the blast had covered his armour. The pristine armour that had visited him last night looked in rough shape. 
Beedel was jumping about trying to avoid the leftover electrical discharge as he yelled down the hall he had come from, “That’s the last time I help you out Skeeter! No more pastries from the market!”
Ren thought he could hear someone yelling back at Beedel from the hall, but couldn’t quite make it out. Beedel continued, “Yeah, yeah, just get out of here. We’ll talk later.” Beedel turned back to notice the large Draconian standing in battle position staring him down. Ren thought he better step in, no sense having these two fight each other.
Beedel started addressing Grummin, “Hello mister warden sir, sorry about the mess. It appears my guide got me a bit lost. You see I’m looking for…” He trailed off as he noticed Ren getting up off of the ground behind Grummin. “Oh! Ren there you are.”
Ren was a little disheartened to see Beedel again. “Beedel what you doing here?” Ren was trying to move this along quickly, he knew Grummin was already irritated. No need to drag this out.
Grummin asked, “Do you know this armoured plant?” Grummin hadn’t dropped his guard stance, even though Beedel had and Ren was now walking forward to get closer to Beedel.
“I do Grummin, he means no harm. I think.” Ren was pretty sure that Beedel was an ally. He wasn’t about to take any chances though as he still stayed closer to Grummin’s side.
“I got some bad news, Ren.” Beedel was excited, frantic even. “My house Ren, it’s gone.”
 “I saw.” Ren suddenly remembered Stephen’s words. About how Beedel was accused of black magic and how some wizards had died. “Did you kill those wizards?”
“Ren you know if they found what I was working on that they’d kill me. I had to destroy everything.” Beedel was desperate Ren could hear it in his voice.
Grummin wasn’t following and really he wasn’t trying to. He kept his eyes on Beedel. Looking for any vicious intent, ready to pounce.
Ren was still trying to determine what had happened. “Beedel, why was I told that you were doing black magic.”  As Ren said it, he knew. He was lied to. It was most likely that Stephen was also lied to as well. This conspiracy started making too much sense for Ren's comfortability.
Beedel was getting impatient too, “I ain’t no black mage, Renny you gotta believe me.” As Beedel spoke that name Grummin finally broke out of his fully defensive stance for a moment to look toward Ren. Grummin knew Ren hated that name.
Although the moment Grummin turned his head Beedel rushed forward swords drawn. Beedel was lightning fast, the thrusters on the back of the armour took most of the credit for that. 
However Grummin’s fighting reflexes were quick too. He blocking several sword blows with his gauntlets. The sounds of metal on metal echoed through the tunnels. Ren could barely keep up with their movements.
Suddenly Beedel’s thrusters shifted to the front of his armour and he blasted himself backwards. Likewise Grummin jumped back with a few powerful leaps. That did nothing to quiet the tension in the air, both fighters just displayed that such distances were trivial to them.
Ren was stunned, he trusted Beedel. He was ready to yell out when Beedel beat him to it, “Ren, this Draconian is bringing you to your death. You must not follow him to the Tower!”
“Grummin would never betray me like that.” Grummin was silent, Ren tried to ignore that. “He’s my friend.” 
“Ren.” Beedel tried to calm his voice. “Do you know what happens to wizards who fail to report black mages?” Beedel rolled his eyes, “Even alleged black mages.”
The fact that Beedel knew so much about the situation was what disturbed Ren the most. That’s when Grummin decided to chime in, he wasn’t particularly focused on the conversation, Draconians tended to have a one track mind and Grummin’s mind was entirely focused on a powerful enemy. “Ren how do you know this Arborian?”
Ren was still trying to deal with Beedel’s question, but he felt getting Grummin under control was the priority here. He wanted to avoid any bloodshed, “Don’t fight him Grum. He’s a friend. Now Beedel what…”
Grummin interrupted, “I don’t take orders from you Ren!” As Grummin spoke he threw his arms out to his side again. Grummin began charging his energy through his gear. The black stripes on his armour began to glow red. The colour was dull at first but after just a few seconds of Grummin flexing his power into it, the faint glow quickly ignited into fiery bursts of colour.
Beedel took a defensive stance in response to Grummin’s charged armour almost as soon as Grummin began charging. Beedel brought both of his arms together in front of him. With a sword in each hand he pushed them together and the two swords began to merge into one. The actions were hard to follow. So many little intricate moving parts working in perfect unison. Once the swords had finished their dance, the hilt began glowing. And outward from the hilt a blast of blue light came shooting along the blade and remained along the edge of the blade.
Ren could tell Beedel was injecting a good deal of energy into his blade. The light itself was wavy. Moving up and down the blade in sharp patterns. The thrusters on the back of the armour opened up as well. The blue flames they emitted were set to a low roar. This was to facilitate the activation, it would save Beedel only a fraction of a second, but that could mean the difference in a battle at this pace.
Both fighters stood their silently for a moment sizing each other up. Ren felt utterly useless to stop them. Nor did he want to physically put himself between them. “Please stop it. Grummin. Beedel. Why are you even fighting right now?” At first Ren wasn’t sure they even heard him. 
Grummin was the first to respond, “The shrub attacked me.” Grummin eyes never left contact with Beedel’s.
Likewise when Beedel spoke he didn’t break eye contact. However whereas Grummin was full of seriousness and rage, Beedel was full of excitement. “I only attacked you to save Renny from the path you’re leading him towards.” There was small pause, then he continued, accusingly at Grummin, “You don’t even know do you?”
Grummin snapped back at him, “I do not need to know the consequences of my orders to carry them out.”
Beedel had a natural way of getting people to say near to exactly what he wanted them to, “Ren don’t you see he’s just another goon for those high wizards. Go ahead and ask him if he’s ever brought a wizard back from a commissioner.” Another silence. Ren was looking towards Grummin, waiting for a response. Grummin moved his eyes very slightly toward Ren, while keeping a visual on Beedel. 
Beedel pushed again, “Go on then, tell him.”
Ren added, “Grum?”
“That’s true Ren. But it doesn’t mean that they died.” Grummin didn’t know enough to sound confident in the matter. As much as he’d hate to admit it, he was a dog, running blindly into whatever danger his superiors would have asked him to.
Ren starting working his memory. It was incredibly rare for any wizard to return to their job after seeing a commissioner. It was mostly assumed they’d been fired or quit or something, but could that many of them have been silenced. It would explain why Ren was so suddenly sentenced to the commissioners if they suspected him to have any connection at all to Beedel.  Now that the details were in front of him, it made sense. Ren was starting to hate it when Beedel made sense.
Beedel interrupted his train of thought, “They kill the wizards who know too much.” 
Ren suddenly realized, he knew too much.
“Ren they know we talked, I’m not sure how they figured it out but they did and you’re no longer safe on your own.”
Ren knew Beedel was right but the fear began surrounding him, “What I am supposed to do Beedel?” Ren was spiraling into a panic attack. 
Grummin, who was now observing Ren carefully, thought he should say something, “Ren.” The weight of the word was enough to snap Ren back into the present. Grummin lowered his guard. His power armour began to power down, then he continued only after he was sure he had Ren's attention. “I don’t fully understand what is going on, but if you’re in danger I want to help.”
Ren was regaining control of his mind. Somehow with Grummin on their side Ren felt better. But Ren remembered Grummin bigger things on his mind, he was needed elsewhere. “Grum. Go save the Roden.”
Grummin began, “I can stay with you, you’re family, Ren.” Grummin was speaking the words, but the insincerity in his voice was clear. Everything in Grummin’s being was telling him to run now and save the Roden before they became nothing more than a page in a history book.
Beedel watched as Ren navigated the social battlefield, he was impressed. Beedel saw a lot of potential in young Renny. Fate must have brought them together for a great reason, at least that was Beedel’s opinion on the matter.
Ren knew that although he would much prefer to have Grummin by his side, Grummin was the only one now who could prevent another massacre. The wardens would be cruel, women and children would suffer the same fate as the fathers, husbands, and brothers who would fight to protect them. Ren really wanted to be selfish, but couldn’t muster up the confidence. “Go Grummin.”
“What about you two?” Grummin was already mentally preparing his route.
Beedel responded, “I’ll keep him safe. We’ll be leaving the city.”
“Tell your superiors,” Ren spoke, “that I ran and escaped with the help of a criminal element.” Ren smirked towards Beedel. Beedel simply smiled back. 
Grummin thought about it for just a moment, but this was merely for show. He had already come to same conclusion, “Alright get moving, and be safe my brother.” 
Ren smiled and said, “Alright, you too. Don’t go getting yourself killed for those rats.”
“I can’t help them if I’m dead.” Grummin was quick to respond then he glanced over to Beedel and spoke to him, “Let’s fight for real some time.”
Beedel had begun to power down his armour and separating his swords. “I would like that.” Beedel gave a great big smile. It made him look very childish. 
Ren and Grummin exchanged a quick embrace. They grabbed each other’s elbows and pulled it in for a hug. Grummin began down one of the corridors when he stopped to ask, “Do you know your way out,” he paused to think of his name, “Beedel?”
Beedel responded, “Yes, that’s right. Until next time Grum.”
“It’s Grummin. Grummin Irontooth.”
“Beedel Circuitwood.”
“Good luck Beedel.”
“Good luck Grum.” Beedel had to hold back a laugh as Grummin turned and ran down the corridor. He thought to himself that these two brothers were very much alike. Now he had to get Ren to safety. 
“C'mon Renny, let’s move.” Ren followed Beedel without hesitation. Some might say that Ren was much too trusting of someone who just recently broke into his house. But when you’ve been fired from your job, have no family, and your whole world view has been shaken most people will try to attach themselves to anything that makes sense. Right now the only thing that made sense to Ren was Beedel.
Speaking of information, “Beedel.” Ren began, “How do you know your way around these tunnels?” 
“I have a friend who helped me. Skeeter. He led me here. I should be able to navigate us backwards out though.” The lack of confidence was concerning to Ren, but he thought to give Beedel the benefit of the doubt. Beedel hadn’t seen him wrong yet. Unless of course you counted, breaking down his doors and almost killing him, getting him fired from his stable job, and almost getting him sent to the commissioners and potentially killed. 
Ren didn’t seem to care much though. A part of him was excited for the changes. Of course he always outwardly claimed to want a comfortable and boring life. But Ren secretly wanted adventure, he just didn’t want to deal with the scary bits involved with adventures. But now that life had thrown him furiously into the heat of a conspiracy with a strange friend. Ren thought he could keep up for a while. See things through to the end. Ren suspected he would eventually come to regret this, but it really was too late to turn back now.

            <Title>Punishing Tardiness</Title>
            <Text>If Ren had run straight to work, he may have only been marginally late. But his blue sky outlook took a sharp turn when he passed by the street that Beedel’s house had been on. He saw plums of dark smoke rising high into the air and his curious wouldn’t let him continue forward without checking.
“Fuck”. Ren whispered as he approached the burning mess that used to be Beedel’s house. He could tell because the tree was still standing in his front yard, although it was seriously damaged. Ren could see the exposed Crystal structure underneath the bark.
There were wizards all about and signs of a struggle. Ren’s heart began to race, and his mind along with it. He was barely aware that he was approaching a lead wizard.
“Uh, what happened here?” Ren’s question snapped him back into the moment.
“Wizard association business. Move along citizen.” 
“I’m a wizard.” Ren added.
The lead wizard looked at Ren curiously and pulled down his glasses to get a better look. After a moment he spoke again, “What’s your level?” 
“C7.” Ren replied nearly automatically.
“This doesn’t concern you.” The wizard returned to their Crystal and began loading a spell.
“But I live nearby. I just want to know…” Ren was cut off.
“This does not concern you, C7.” The wizard went back to ignoring Ren.
Ren got the picture and left quickly. He managed to make it to work only a couple hours late. His mind was racing the whole way. But as he approached the office he made note of the Wizard Tower not far in the distance. The top of the Wizard Tower was the headquarters all of things wizardly in the city. At the top of the tower spiral architecture surrounded the arcane flame, constant and brilliant. 
Ren couldn’t stop  thinking of the grand wizards and Beedel’s story. He tried to silence that train of thought as he entered his office. He would further investigate the matter with his superiors at a later time, when he was a little more emotionally stable. He was confident the explanation would become clear. For now he just needed to do some tedium to regain his equilibrium. Ren truly enjoyed his work. Auditing was boring in most respects, but the repetitive nature of the work calmed him.
His office was a plain four story building. Not many windows and the decor was abysmal. Mostly grey furniture. For wizards you’d think things would be a bit more colourful. One interesting feature was that it had underground connections to the nearby buildings. All of the buildings in the Wizard Association were connected via the tunnels. However there were no direct paths and it took years of training to become efficient at navigating them. Those trained in this very specific purpose were called the wardens. The wardens were also skilled fighters, which was necessary. The occasional mutant uprising, or the frequent molemen attacks kept the wardens quite busy.
Ren had been down through the tunnels many times. The quickest route to his favorite bakery was through the eastward tunnel from his office. This specific route of the tunnels was usually monster free. However he had once run into a group of wardens fighting off some sort of slimy monstrosity. He lent them a hand and got to know one or two of the wardens. As far as Ren was concerned they weren’t as bad as most wizards thought. Wizards tended to look down upon them as necessary savages. Although most wizards also refused to go through the tunnels without a at least one warden as an escort.
Ren paused outside the office doors. He wondered if he’d be able to sneak in. “Julia might have covered for me.” Ren thought about calling her but then remembered she’s at the tower now. Ren realized that without Julia, Carson would definitely notice his absence, which meant his boss, Stephen, knew too.
Ren entered the office carrying his bag on one shoulder and inside of it BugBot was busy scanning the area. The creature lay in wait for a good time to spring into action.
Everything from the trip up to the fourth floor to the walk to his desk seemed perfectly normal. But a feeling of dread crept into Ren. Something was wrong, no one had said a word to him. Ren had just put his jacket on the coat hook in his cubicle and placed his bag on the floor when he noticed Stephen standing just behind him.
“Shit Steve, don’t sneak up on me like that.” Ren was disappointed at the lack of a laugh or at least a small show of emotion out of Stephen.
Stephen’s looming quality began to show itself, “Ren. You’re late. Again.” His voice was cold. “This kind of behaviour is harmful to the association.”
Ren tried to remain respectful of his superior, “I’m really sorry Stephen, I’ll work late tonight. I’ll be set up and ready to start in just a few minutes.”
Ren thought for a moment that he saw some sympathy in Stephen’s eyes, but then Stephen spoke, “I’m sorry Ren. You’re going to see a commissioner.”
Ren was shocked. Commissioners were the punitive judge, jury, and prosecution of the Wizard Association. Most wizards didn’t leave the meeting with a job or worse they could permanently revoke your Crystal license.
“A commissioner? Just because I was late?” Ren asked. As he did he spotted Carson on the other side of the office watching them intently with a huge grin.
“No Ren,” Stephen’s voice cut him down, “Not only is this your seventh infringement of our tardiness policy but you also messed up last night.” 
“I don’t… uh…” Ren tried to think of an explanation. 
“Enough Ren.” Stephen interrupted. “This is because of the spike last night. You said you’d check it out. But it turned out to be a source of black magic. A big one.” 
“Beedel.” Ren muttered.
Stephen ignored him, “A squad was sent out but it was too late. Some wizards are dead. It just makes things worse for you that you were late today. The commissioner has been waiting.”
Ren was confused. Could Beedel have been lying to him. It surely made more sense then all that other business. Ren pleaded, “Stephen please, you know I’m a good worker, I don’t deserve this.”
Stephen grabbed Ren's bag from the ground and held it out to him, “It’s out of my hands now Ren. Go answer the questions and maybe we’ll see you tomorrow.” 
Ren reached for his bag. But to his shock, he noticed a wooded claw reaching out from the top. Stephen noticed Ren's confusion and turned the bag around to look himself. Quick as lightning, the little creature scuttled up Stephen’s arm. He screamed. 
By now the few employees who hadn’t been watching the scene, had gotten up from their desks to look over their cubicle walls. Stephen’s reflexes were quick and he snatched the creature just as it jumped away from his body. “What is this Ren?”
“I have no idea.” Ren replied.
“Ren, we do not bring toys into the office.” Stephen’s anger had calmed for a moment just as BugBot clamped down onto his fingers. It was painful enough that Stephen yelled out in pain and dropped it. That’s exactly what BugBot wanted, the construct then ran swiftly around the cubicle’s corner. 
Stephen reactively grabbed his Crystal and cast a destructive spell, “Burn!” The flame shot out from his Crystal at a pace that would rival one of Ren's bullets but Stephen was not quick enough. It burned a small patch of carpet, the scent filled Ren's nostrils and he coughed the stink away. 
BugBot had scurried under some furniture and was now out of sight. Stephen approached a nearby drawer with predatory caution. He was holding his Crystal in his left hand and his right was pointed with his index and middle fingers pointed like a gun. Ren had seen Stephen do this before, as far as Ren knew it didn’t have any affect on the magic, but maybe it helped Stephen’s aim.
Ren had never heard such silence in this room before. There was always someone on the phone, or typing a report, or casting a spell. Stephen slowly bent to the ground and the silence grew deeper. 
Stephen’s Crystal was charged and ready for several more blasts of fire. As soon as his head was low enough to see under the drawer he cursed, “Shit!” Stephen had noticed a small fresh hole in the wall behind the drawer.
Stephen rose up quickly off of the ground and his eyes met Ren's. Ren could see the rage building in Stephen’s eyes. Stephen took a deep breath and then yelled out, “CARSON!”
As the silence was now broken most of the wizards knew to get back to work rather than face any of Stephen’s wrath. It only took Carson a few seconds to find his way, he’d been waiting to be beckoned. 
Carson stopped on a dime right at Stephen’s side. He gave a quick smirk toward Ren and began to address his master’s needs, “Yes, Stephen?”
Stephen tried to restrain his anger when talking to Carson, every word spoken as if it’s own sentence, “Find. That. Little. Bug. And smash it!” 
Carson quickly understood his task. Search and destroy. Carson took a quick look around. He made note of the small scorch mark on the carpet. Then he dropped to the floor and found the hole in the wall rather quickly. Carson jumped back up to his feet. He gripped his Crystal and mimicked Stephen’s finger gun stance.
Stephen turned his attention back to Ren, “Go to the basement. There’s a warden waiting.” 
“Yes sir.” Ren replied. He began his way towards to lift. He watched as several of his co-wizards looked around, confused. None really cared to say anything, no one cared that he was leaving. 
The office itself wasn’t very large, there was maybe thirty or so people inside, including Carson frantically searching around the room. Stephen joined him. Both of their hands raised with that completely unnecessary technique. To Ren they appeared as children playing a game.
Ren hit the button to call the lift. It would only take a moment or two for it to arrive. As he waited he heard the bug hunters shouting and shooting. 
“Found it! Under that chair!”
“Which chair?”
“The one right beside your leg!”
“Which leg?”
More blasts. Ren lost track of their voices. A few other wizards joined in. Ren was quite surprised that little wooden creature was lasting so long. And he wondered how it found its way into his bag.
“I lost it.”
“It went this way!”
Ren began silently cheering for the little guy. Something about the look of it made him sympathetic. The lift arrived and the doors slid open. Ren walked into the small room that would transport him down into the tunnels. He hoped that it would be a warden he knew. A battle story or two might cheer him up.
As he stood waiting for the doors to close he saw the chaos in the room slowly grow. Ren wondered how one little thing could cause such a mess. A couple spots in the room had caught fire now and there were more than a few wizards running around every which way. Some were trying to kill the bug. Others wanted to avoid the blasts. Some just wanted to be left alone with their work, like Ren.
The most frustrating part, Ren realized as the doors were closing on the chaotic scene, was that he wasn’t able to get any work done.

            <Title>The Morning After</Title>
            <Text>Ren awoke, mostly due to discomfort. His pull-out couch mattress was no prize winner, but whenever he slept on the cushions instead it made everything ache. Adding to the pain, his arm had somehow gotten lodged behind his head. His eyes hurt. His head hurt. Everything hurt. This couch would get the best of him. He briefly thought about fetching the real bed from the house. But Ren had pretty much refused to go in there except when absolutely necessary.
Ren's memory of the night before was fuzzy. He almost believed that the intruding armoured treeman with plans to topple the government was all just some bad dream. Almost believed it. The rubble of the two inner doorways quickly reconfirmed the events of the night before. Ren sighed.
Ren looked around. He considered making a couple eggs for breakfast. Maybe take it easy, do some crafting. and go over the details of Beedel’s story. He was about to stand up and get the day moving forward when the thought hit him. Today was a work day. He checked the clock. And he was late. “Just great.” Ren muttered. The last thing he needed was his boss on his back about another late start.
Ren groomed his hair back with his hands. It really only made things worse with his mid length shaggy brown hair, but Ren wasn’t trying to impress anyone. He grabbed a tube of breakfast from the small fridge. He was halfway out the door before he remembering to grab his work bag. He rushed back passed the collapsed doorways, and passed the forge. His workbench was still a mess. Ren had a lot of work to do after work.
He reached for the bag and pulled it over his shoulder. If Ren had been paying more attention he might have noticed the small wooden creature occasionally moving around the inside the bag. 
Just as Ren was turning to leave the room he heard a weird thud against the far wall. If he had been facing the window he might have noticed the faint purple glow of magic too. Ren thought about it for a moment. He approached the window, but he couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary. He shrugged it off as some daft animal.
He quickly rushed to the front door. If he hurried he may be able to sneak in without anyone noticing his tardiness. He stopped and looked back. He rarely locked his door, but something in him thought it might be a good idea to start. 
Maybe a small lesson learned from last night’s experience. Although even a magical lock wouldn’t have stopped Beedel’s power armour from bursting through the door.
Ren reassured himself that perhaps Beedel was just a crazy Arborian who’s abused a substance or two too many. Or on the other hand, maybe black mages really were hunting him. Ren didn’t want to get involved either way. But somehow he felt he wouldn’t be able to avoid Beedel now that he knew these so called secrets. 
Ren sighed again and then he yawned. He locked the door was a quick spell he knew. Just a simple reinforcement spell. Green light shimmered from his Crystal and jumped towards the door handle. Finally the light landed into the lock and the whole mechanism glowed green for just a moment. At the apex of the glow Ren could hear a quiet series of locking sounds. Magic was often flashy and noisy. Ren preferred the simpler, less overt kinds, the exception being when it came to his bullets.
After he locked the door, he took a good look around. In some respects, last night was a near death experience. Ren took the time to really appreciate his world. Simple as it may be, the man liked it that way. There wasn’t much to worry about. 
Today was a prime day for a new outlook. The skies were that lovely shade of blue. The clouds seemed to be calling out to him, come sleep on us, is what Ren imagined them saying.
One last sigh, this one of relief. Then Ren was on his way. Even if he was late, Ren felt he could handle the small scolding. Everything would be back to normal before dinner.
Ren hadn’t notice the unnatural silence as he left his workshop. He was too optimistic to notice such things as that. He had his eyes on the uncharacteristic bright day. Novos was not known to have good weather. Magic had a funny way of distorting the normal flow of things. It made forecasting troublesome. Even still a bright sunny day was a rarity, that was known for sure.
Soon Ren was gone, completely out of sight. 
“Finally gone.” Umbra whispered to herself, “This should do for a little while.” Umbra had managed to wander through town disoriented. She now found herself nearby a quiet residential area. To be precise she was outside of Ren's workshop. She had fumbled into the side of the wall earlier and had since used a silencing spell to avoid any unnecessary interactions. Now that Ren was gone she tried the door. It was locked. But this wouldn’t stop her. She loaded a quick spell into her Crystal and the strands of purple magic swiftly found their way into the lock. 
Umbra swung the door open. She needed rest, badly. Her consciousness was fading quickly. She had given it almost everything she had not to pass out in the middle of the street on the way here. That wasn’t a smart thing for a lady to do in the big city. 
She was walking by, when she noticed Ren rushing around frantically inside. When she crept to get a closer look, it appeared that the man inside was rushing to get dressed. She figured he’d be out of there soon, so she waited. Umbra’s hunch paid off.
Now that she was inside his shop, she took a quick look around. The doorway at the far side of the room was crumbled and the one beyond that as well. She could see the forge equipment in the other room but what grabbed her attention was the sink in this one. She needed water.
Umbra’s abdomen had be sliced open. Everything was still in its proper place, but she needed to get some medical attention soon. If she could only find something to patch herself up, she might be able to make it to the train station and back to Jak’s place. 
The pain was getting worse. She practically waddled over to the sink. She pulled her scarf and hood off. The tap water was discoloured. Chloe’s high class instincts were kicking in, but the survival instincts were stronger and she drank. It was so refreshing. But it didn’t solve her major problem. She found some clothes nearby that she could make into bandages. Looked like dirty laundry on the floor. She grabbed them, nearly passed out as she bent over.
She waited a moment then began ripping but the actions made her dizzy again. She was losing her balance. After stumbling against the counter, she found a few bottles of pills. She recognized one as a pain reducer. She needed to sit. Umbra grabbed the pills, and headed for the small couch.
The couch was still warm from Ren's slumber. She collapsed over it. It was struggle to pull herself up onto it. But she managed. She had gotten this far, she thought, she can take these meds and make it home. Sleep this whole thing off.
Umbra was not going to make it home. She was fading fast. She quickly popped a couple pills and swallowed them without water. She wasn’t used to it and it made her gag up a little. She didn’t have a choice at this point, she knew the walk back to the sink might as well have been a canyon to her now. The meds worked quickly, but it wasn’t helping the blood loss. She still had the ripped clothes. She sat up as best she could and began tying them around her wound. She was just getting it around her waist when her hands went numb. 
Umbra’s vision started to fade. Her head felt so light. Like it was just floating on down to the couch cushion. Before she even realized it she was horizontal on the couch. Her whole body was going numb.The last thing she thought of before passing out was that she hoped Jak would forgive her. She screwed up. It was an easy job and she got cocky. Idiot.

            <Title>Beedel's Fight</Title>
            <Text>Beedel was out walking for hours after his talk with Ren. He was fairly disappointed with the outcome, both that Ren had been scared off of the conversation and that Beedel had left BugBot behind.
“I hope he’s ready.” Beedel was nervous about sending BugBot into the system so soon after he’d been awakened. Beedel also hoped his creation wouldn’t cause any trouble for Ren.
His walk had been clarifying and he was now heading home, although he was still a quarter hour away. That’s when he noticed the fresh crimson stains splattered onto the street near one of his favourite convenience shops. 
Beedel reacted by taking stance and scanning the nearby area. It was late and the shop was closed and nobody was around. Except, Beedel noticed, a woman in the distance dressed in all black. From what he could tell she was limping and the blood trail looked to lead to her.
“Excuse me miss.” Beedel called out. 
The woman didn’t respond but kept on moving down the street away from him. She appeared to the looking for something. Her head jutting back and forth looking into the shops and houses in the area.
Beedel began to follow her. He noticed her pace began to increase. “Are you alright? I’m not going to hurt you.”
The woman tried to pick up her pace but Beedel could tell that she was struggling. She rummaged for something on her person. She found it and leaned her head down. Beedel couldn’t quite see what she was doing but he had an idea it involved snorting something. 
“I know this armour looks scary, but trust me I’m a nice guy.” Beedel was making up the distance quickly without full on running towards her. Once he was just out of reach he spoke once more. “I can get you to a hospital…” He trailed off and blinked for a moment. He was stunned when the woman had suddenly launched herself into a full sprint down the nearest alley.
He turned to follow her but she was fast. Fast enough to make Beedel consider igniting his thrusters to keep up.
“You’re hurt!” Beedel called out.
Behind these buildings were narrow maze like alleys. Beedel began to feel suspicious and slowed his pace slightly to take in more detail of his surroundings.
The woman was slowing down. Beedel suspected she wouldn’t be able to keep up this pace. She turned another corner and then he saw the faint glow of a spell casting emanate from around the same corner.
Beedel slowed down and drew one of his swords. He focused for just a moment and the Crystal within the sword reacted to his energy. The sword itself was but a mere skeleton of a blade. Once Beedel poured some energy into it, a blade of pure light extended from the metallic base. The light fluctuated to Beedel’s focus, energy blades required strict discipline to use effectively.
Beedel rounded the corner ready for anything. But he was surprised to find nothing and nobody.  Still suspicious, he checked his rear for an incoming trap, nothing. He checked the sky, nothing. 
He sighed. “Guess she didn’t need any help.” He kept his sword drawn while he returned to the main street, still weary of a trap. Once he exited the alleys he deactivated his blade and returned it to his side.
An older man was watching nearby with wide eyes of interest and fear.
“Hello.” Beedel greeted.
The man seemed unsure and crossed the street to get away from Beedel.
“Fucking city.” Beedel sighed.
He continued on his way home trying to convince himself that he should stop trying to help strangers. It made him think of Ren. He liked Ren a lot and in other circumstances he imagined they could be good friends.
It only took Beedel a few more minutes to get to his street. What he saw when he lifted his head concerned him greatly. He could make out at least two people snooping around his place. He was still a little ways off but he was pretty certain of what they were doing but he needed to know for sure before he could act.
At this distance Beedel could tell they were wizards. Beedel strolled up confidently to his home and approached the closest person. This wizard had their Crystal out and was scanning the area. Beedel seemed to catch her off guard.
“What are you doing?” He asked.
She jumped, startled. “Shit.” She twisted and raised her Crystal towards Beedel.
“Woah hold on.” Beedel raised both his hands palms out. Beedel could understand the shock and the fact that he was still wearing his power armour didn’t help the situation. 
The wizard’s Crystal was glowing, spell loaded, ready to fire off a shot, but she refused to make eye contact. After a moment of analysis the wizard lowered her Crystal. “This is official Wizard Association business. We believe there is a black mage in this house. It would be best if you moved along. Things might get ugly.”
Beedel took a moment to observe his home. He could see two more wizards cautiously looking into his windows and he guessed there might be more on the other side. These wizard squads tended to work in groups of 5.
“What will you do when you find the black mage?” Beedel asked while he analyzed possibilities. He could easily escape but he didn’t want any of his research data to fall into association hands.
“We will try to avoid a conflict but the mage must be subdued and brought in for questioning.” The wizard was starting to look impatient. “Please move along now.”
“How do you know he’s in there?” Beedel asked ignoring the wizards request.
While she replied she kept her eyes on her squad. “We’ve been tracking this one for a while. A spike earlier this evening was submitted improperly and it led us to this location.” She raised her arms gesturing to the whole surrounding area, “If we didn’t catch it, all of these people could have been in danger.”
Beedel thought of Ren. “What will happen to the wizard who missed this?”
The wizard looked suspiciously at Beedel. “There will be an evaluation. They will likely be terminated to protect the security of our city.”
Beedel didn’t like the way she pronounced terminated.
“Now please move along citizen.”
Beedel began walking down the road. He looked back and the wizard had returned to watching her squad. “Oh just one more thing.” Beedel said cheerfully.
“I do not have time for this.” She replied.
Beedel ignored her once again. “You won’t find any black magic in there.”
The wizard looked confused for a moment. Beedel raised his arm up to access his wrist bound Crystal. He tapped it a few times as he hummed whimsically.
“How can you know that?” She demanded.
Beedel looked up and made eye contact. He could see that for the first time she’d noticed he was an Arborian. Arborians were rare in the city and Beedel knew that they were looking for him. Beedel also knew that these wizards would rather see him silently killed then brought in for questioning. This was the fourth time he’d been visited by a group of wizards like this, but this time he was prepared.
“Because this is my house.” Beedel smiled, his face plate lowered into place, and he tapped his Crystal once more. His house erupted in a contained blast of green fire. The shock wave nearly knocked him off his feet at this distance, even though he had braced himself. The wizard eying him was not so prepared and she was flung towards the road.
The other wizards had taken the brunt of the force, including the various bits of shrapnel and the scorching heat. He could barely make out the details with the bright green light but he could count at least three scorched corpses.
“Lucky!” Beedel smiled as he turned towards the wizard who’d been flung. She looked hurt but he wouldn’t take any chances with them, not anymore. 
She began to stand up. Beedel drew both his blades charging them with his inner energy. Once charged he did the same with his armour, activating the thrusters on the back.
The wizard now faced him. Confusion had left her, now there was purely anger. She lifted her Crystal and in that moment Beedel charged.
She blasted ray after ray towards him, but his speed was too much for her. He was within range to attack when she released a wave of energy that knocked him back.
She laughed as he tumbled backward. “I’m afraid you’ve brought a sword to a magic fight.”
“These aren’t just swords.” Beedel grinned. “Their customized.”
“Burn!” She charged for a moment fueling her magic with anger and launched a powerful ray towards Beedel. He stood firm bracing himself against the incoming magic. With his swords crossed the energy from the blades flowed into a circular pattern and he used that to block the ray. It was deflected to a nearby building. People had started waking up to the commotion. Some had ventured outside but most looked from windows and relative safety.
“We better make this quick.” Beedel suggested.
The wizard did not reply and she charged him. Beedel lowered his shield and propelled himself into the air with lightning speed. The wizard shot at him from below and he continued to either dodge or deflect that attacks back to the ground. 
“Get down here coward!” The wizard screamed. “It is time to pay for your crimes against the association.” In a blink Beedel dropped to the ground right in front of the wizard. She smiled as she began charging another blast wave. “Got you.”
Beedel was swinging for her but with his blades crossed as before. Just before she released the energy he poured his full power into his shield. It deflected most of it back to her, knocking the wizard back and she landed in the side of a building denting the structure around her point of impact.
She was about ready to get up and continue when Beedel was suddenly upon her with the tip of his blade touching her stomach. “Got you.” He ended it.
Crowds were beginning to form and Beedel knew he needed to flee before any more wizards showed up. They would be sending more powerful ones now. He looked back at his house. The flames had died down and he was thankful that none of the other wizards had survived the blast.
Then he laucnhed down the street at full speed. Once he was a good distance from the scene he slowed and found an alley to duck into. He’d take it slow from here, a couple of those blasts had damaged his armour. He checked it over, nothing serious, which was lucky. He’d gotten pretty good at fighting these low level wizards.
Beedel pulled up his Crystal and looked through it for a moment. Once he found the right contact he made a call.
“Yeah I’ll need to see Skeeter, is he there?” Beedel listened. “Good tell him to meet me in the tunnels. The usual spot.”

            <Title>Underground War</Title>
            <Text>Sirens pierced through Grummin’s dreamless sleep. He tried to sleep through it, he needed to sleep through it. But he couldn’t. The fighting hadn’t stopped for three whole days. Though it was hard for them to call it fighting, Grummin felt it was more like a slaughter. This was the only rest Grummin had gotten since the first wave of chimeras assaulted the Draconian undercity.  
“Grummin, get off your ass.” Krozan’s voice boomed into his mind. Grummin cared less and less to be around his uncle these days.
“I’m up.” Grummin replied, without moving from his cot.
“Your comrades are dying out there.” Krozan was never happy. “You should be out there with them.”
“No one’s died.” Grummin replied. “These beasts are numerous, but we’re well fortified.” 
Grummin opened his eyes, Krozan was standing over him in full battle armour. His uncle’s green scales clashed with the black and red of the armour.
Grummin chuckled, “That looked better on Dad.” His father’s armour was one of the best around, some of the most advanced technology had gone into it. Several of the highest ranked wizards looked over it’s creation themselves. It was befitting the Lord of the Wardens. But it didn’t sit quite so well on his uncle’s shoulders.
“I’m in no mood for your attitude.” Krozan snarled.
Grummin sat up, “Then I’ll just be getting out of your way.” He began towards the chest nearby where he stored his gear.
“No you won’t be going back out there today.” Krozan’s foot slammed onto the chest, his claws raping on the wood.
Grummin gave his uncle a serious look, making eye contact for the first time since he’d woke up. Tensions were high between them as they usually were. But Grummin tried to ignore his uncle as he moved towards his chest and pushed his uncle aside. Grummin began grabbing his gear, it was caked in dry blood. “Oh? Then where are you sending your prized fighter?”
“You’ll be on escort duty today.” Krozan couldn’t hide his smile.
“What?” Grummin stopped. “Escorting. Today? It’s not safe down here for those wizards.” 
“Make it safe.” 
“This is just be the beginning, someone is creating these beasts, and they will create more. Bigger ones will come.” Grummin didn’t like the sound of himself pleading.
“And we will handle them.” Krozan replied. “Intelligence has located the source, they appear to be coming from the rats.”
Grummin was surprised, the Roden and the Draconians had a long troubled history, but such an attack would mean war in the tunnels and neither society wanted another war. 
“Don’t call them that.” Grummin replied, “The Roden can’t be behind this, they hate using magic.”
“They must hate us more.” Krozan began walking out of the room. “Get to your post on the West side of the Tower. Clear the area of any pests while you await further instructions.” With that Krozan left. 
Grummin tried to wrap his mind around the mess his Uncle was making. Doing so only made Grummin think of his father and the pain that came with those thoughts. He quickly collected his things and donned his armour. The red armour suited his own red scales. Grummin opted for a set of power armour that lacked a torso, so he could remain quick and focus more power into his gauntlets. Once he had all his gear ready he began making way. 
The undercity of Novos was a catacomb of tunnels and civilizations. It was once a great dungeon of some long forgotten legendary evil. More recently it had been the home of thousands of types of creatures. They all lived violent chaos. Furiously trying to carve out space for themselves and their kin. Then during Grummin’s father’s time, the High Wizards ordered the tunnels to become an official property of the Wizard Association. Bezelnorf Irontooth led the charge and become known as the Lord of the Wardens. But he was gone now.
Grummin thought of his father daily. He always wanted to be like Bezelnorf. His father made peace with many of the creatures in the tunnels. The undercity spanned five times the radius of Novos, so peace pacts were made so that the center would be reserved for wizards and their business guarded by the Wardens and the other creatures could live freely in the outer areas. There was of course still resistance, but that’s why the Wardens remain active. To guard and guide travelers through the maze like passages.
Grummin walked solemnly through the tunnels. The sirens continued to blare, but he’d grown accustomed to them by now. With every step he felt the pain of leaving his comrades.
“They should fucking close the tunnel.” Grummin snarled. “We need everyone on the front line.” But he marched forward regardless of his words. Grummin could not disobey an order from his Lord, doing so would give Krozan all the reason he needed to strip Grummin of his rank permanently.
Grummin’s steps became slower. He tried to focus on the task at hand, “Just guide some stupid wizard through the stupid tunnels and then I can get back.”
Grummin heard an explosion echo towards him from the direction of the front line. He looked back, “To hell with this my brothers need me.” Grummin began sprinting back towards the way he’d come. 
After a minute or so of full sprint Grummin passed by a familiar corridor, it led to the officers’s conference room. Grummin just barely caught a glimpse of his uncle by the colour of his father’s armour. Those bright red power gauntlets always caught his eye.
Grummin slowed and then crept down the corridor towards the conference room. He listened first to the echos of their speech. He could hear his uncle talking with some of the other officers.
“What do you mean they aren’t in position yet?” Krozan was yelling.
“These chimeras are giving us more trouble than expected, sir.” One officer replied.
“They aren’t supposed to be that far out.” Another added to the conversation.
Grummin approached slowly. His curiosity peaked.
“Just get them in position.” Krozan commanded. “We can’t let any of these rats get wind of our men for this to work.”
A boisterous officer spoke up, “You need not worry sir. Our men are equipped with the latest stealth gear. They will not be caught. Sir.”
“That’s right damn it. These chimeras are more chaotic than we thought, but we are the Draconian Wardens.” Krozan rallied. “We will show those dirty rats that there is no longer room for them in our tunnels.” 
Grummin was stunned by the officers’s cheer. “Kill them all!”
Grummin began backtracking immediately. Once he reached the end of the corridor he turned to run down the tunnel. He didn’t know where he was going, or what exactly he overheard but he was fairly certain hundreds of lives were at stake.
“Grummin?” The voice was familiar and refreshing.
“Petra.” Grummin didn’t know what to say. “I.. I’m.. uh.”
“I know Grummin.” Petra settled her hand on his neck. 
Grummin could only look into her eyes with utter confusion. “You do?”
“Yeah, escort duty.” Petra smiled. The blue scales around her eyes twinkled. “Especially right now. Krozan must still be pissed at you.”
Grummin had nearly forgotten about the escort mission. “Right, thanks for reminding me actually.”
“You’re such a slime brain.” Petra laughed. “But if you forget about this one Krozan will have you exiled.” Petra was smiling but her eyes were stern.
“But this is so much bigger than the escort, Petra.” Grummin began.
“I know.” She interrupted. “But go and get it done. Then come save us.” She rolled her eyes at him.
Grummin mulled it over. Petra gave him a moment and then interrupted his thoughts.
“There’s only one on schedule, and it’s a commission.” She reached out towards Grummin’s chin and lifted it so their eyes met. “Makes you wonder what the poor guy did to deserve it.”
Grummin laughed, “I don’t care if those bloody mages lose their magic.”
“I know. But they do.”
“Okay.” Grummin paused, considering his next words, “but I need something from you.”
Petra raised her brow.
“Stall Krozan.”
She looked confused. “Why?”
“I can’t explain. But it’s important.” Grummin added.
“I don’t know if I can stall him much from the fight.”
“Just do something. Any little bit will help.”
Petra gave him a confused look and shook her head, “Why do I let you rope me into these things.”
“Because you love me.” Grummin winked.
“Shut up, ya jerk!” Petra swatted at him as she yelled.
Grummin didn’t waste any time and began moving towards the west tunnels.
Petra turned to watch him go. “Just for that I might not help you.”
“Thanks!” Grummin yelled back at her. “I owe you one.”
“More like a million!”
As they separated their smiles faded. Thrust back into the present Grummin rushed forward as long as the Wizard wasn’t late he should be able to figure out what’s going on before Krozan was able to do anything drastic.

            <Title>Final Stop</Title>
            <Text>The night was perfect. Everything going exactly to plan. Umbra was on her way to the light train station. It operated at all hours, but was seldom used during the night in this part of town. She made it there fairly quickly. She figured she could take the roof tops and skip the zigzagging of the streets with a bit of athletics. Plus she wanted to test out her new tools. The ring gave her an uncanny dexterity and combined with her improved sense from the Dust, she was all but flying across the cityscape. 
Most of the buildings around this side of town were low to ground, so even if she did fall the risk of injury was low. She laughed, thinking that if she fell she’d probably make the landing anyway. As she leapt towards the light train station she took in the beauty of her city. She’d grown up here, she’d trained here. She had broken into many of these places. Although the rule was she was never suppose to take anything. Her training was dominantly to teach her how to enter somewhere and leave without a trace. Leaving no traces was the key to being a successful thief. And a thief is exactly what Chloe wanted to be, and what Umbra was.
Tonight was the night of her first legitimate heist after all. The goal was an estate in uptown Novos. Her grandmother’s estate to be exact. It was the perfect spot for her first real heist. She knew the area intimately, she knew where they kept the valuables, she even knew many of the guards schedules and habits.
She was approaching the light train now. It was easily the tallest structure in this district. The train lines ran all across Novos reaching every district of the city and beyond into neighboring cities too. 
The station itself was nearly 50 meters up. The rail lines coming out of it were encased in huge tubes full of fluorescent light. The light shifted and morphed slowly. Creating the impressions of a gelatinous filling. 
Every few minutes or so Umbra made note of the small spherical capsules that made their way into or out of the terminal. The ones shooting outward were much faster than the ones coming in. She didn’t know too much about how the light train worked as her parents refrained from using it instead opting for the much slower coach wagons. Umbra chuckled, thinking of how her parents were stuck in the stone age. 
Umbra reached the station but she still needed to get down to street level to access the door.  She thought for a moment, analyzing the structure of the station, “I wonder…” Her gaze shifted erratically until she found it. “Perfect, an open window.”
She backed up a few steps on the roof and got a running start. Her leap surprised herself as she cleared the distance with ease. Umbra grabbed hold of the building and began climbing without hesitation. The architecture was suitable for climbing, but it was her confidence that made it easy. Chloe would have been the kind of girl to gingerly lower herself down from a meter tall ledge, Umbra, evidently, would leap from rooftop to rooftop. She’d changed so much in the past year. 
Umbra reached the top of the building and hopped into the window. She took a moment to look around for any witnesses, but the terminal was mostly empty. The only one around was the ticket clerk who wasn’t quite aware of her surroundings. 
Umbra walked over to the ticket counter. A young lady was working the counter. “One for Uptown Plaza.” She placed the money on the counter, exact change.
The young lady, was startled by the sudden appearance of a customer. Most customers at this hour were in bound and thus didn’t need to interact with her.
The clerk responded, “Ticket for where?””
“Uptown Plaza.” Umbra spoke as politely as she could and pushed the change closer toward her on the counter. The clerk fumbled with it for a moment and nearly dropped it. After a few moments of checking her monitors the clerk told her, “Please board capsule 216 and await further instruction.”
“Thank you.” Umbra said. She grabbed her ticket and went on her way. There was no one waiting in line which was good. But she still had to wait for the incoming arrival before she could board. Dozens of bright monitors made that very clear. They also said it wouldn’t be long now.
One side of the loading bay contained all the capsules. There were different sizes. Singles, doubles, family sized, and cargo. Number 216 was near the front and it was a double. Chloe looked around but didn’t see anyone else waiting. She thought it strange. 
All the capsules except the cargo ones, contained seats. The outside shells were made of a special coloured glass. One half was blue the other half was red. There was also a faint white strip around the circumference dividing the two colours. That strip is where the latches  and air holes were.
The middle of the bay contained the giant metallic arms that stretched and moved around to organize and prepare the capsules. Currently all four arms were almost motionless, kind of dangling, almost as if asleep. Their shoulders were connected to the ground and their elbows pointed directly upward. Each finger was the size of a large person and the arms were very muscular. They were all completely silver, made out of some kind of steel and imbued with powerful magic. They seemed to have a life of their own. Sometimes they would juggle together, other times they would play games with each other, high five, thumb wars, things like that.  
The other side of the small bay housed the large glowing tube. Up close it was mesmerizing. Almost like piece of art. Constantly changing so you could stare for hours. It was about four meters in diameter, most of the capsules were at least two meters in diameter. There was no room for more than one capsule at a time but thankfully the trips were very fast. So wait times weren’t usually long. 
This bay also housed a junction box. It was a large black box with no notable features except for the three large glowing tubes sticking into it. The junction box is what created the forces necessary to propel and attract the capsules.
Just then a voice came on the speaker, “Incoming. Please stand clear of the arms.” The arm closest to Umbra began to move. It stretched itself out a little bit, then shook it’s fingers awake. The hand opened a latch on the large tube and stuck itself inside with it’s palm open outward, waiting to catch the incoming capsule. The arrival was fairly slow, not much faster than a wagon. Jak had once explained that the capsules moved the quickest when they were leaving and they slowed as they approached their destination due to the pressure forces at play within the tube interacting with the capsules.
The man inside this single capsule was suited, and totally calm. Probably returning from some business meeting in the city center. The arm pulled him out slowly from the tube. Then with a flick of the wrist it tossed the capsule across the terminal towards another arm, which then passed it along to the next. The arms were all perfectly in sync and caught the capsule perfectly. 
As it flew through the air the capsule rotated but the chair and man inside did not. The man was as calm as ever. Barely even noticing the goings on around him. His face was glued to his Crystal. 
The voice came back over the speaker, “Now boarding for Uptown Plaza, capsule 216.” The big arm reached over and grabbed the capsule. Brought it towards Umbra and unlocked it. The glass lids popped open and Umbra climbed in. She fastened her belt and the arm closed the lids. Then he picked her up and moved her towards the tube. Chloe hadn’t ever used the train system and normally she’d be nervous. Umbra however was not nervous, in fact she was excited. Overflowing with energy.
The arm slowly placed the capsule into the tube, making very sure to keep it stable with the blue side pointed towards Novos. The inside of the tube was magical, visually speaking. From this perspective you could actually see the lines of light that made up the rails. Looking directly forward looked like a surreal painting that she would fall into as soon as the arm released her. 
The arm was slowly adjusting it’s grip when the voice on the speaker returned, “Capsule 216 to Uptown Plaza ready for departure.” The hand began rotating the capsule so the red side would be facing outward. Her chair remained pointed forward during the rotation. 
Almost immediately Umbra could feel the pressure begin to push the capsule outbound. The pressure was strong, but the hand’s grip was stronger, and the capsule’s structure, she hoped, was strongest.
Once the capsule was fully rotated the pressure was almost painful. Once again the voice on the speaker, “Ready… Release.” And she was gone. 
There was barely anytime to even think before she was already well on her way. The ride was incredibly fast, but in no way was it rough. Umbra thought she could get used to this. She tried to remember how long they said it would take and guessed no more than a few minutes at this pace.
She gazed towards the city lights, at this time of night that had such a beauty. Novos expanded so far into every direction, but far to the east Umbra could now see the Dying Wood by the sea side. It’s borders pushed up directly against the city. The treaty with the Arborians had prohibited any more removal of forest land. Umbra had never met an Arborian as most of them lived in the woods, but wondered if she might one day, her new life held so many possibilities.

            <Title>Late Night Visitor</Title>
            <Text>Ren was sitting in his workshop tinkering on his latest project. Bulletsmithing was an long forgotten craft that had been passed down to Ren from his father. The workshop was out back behind his house. Ren owned them both since his mother’s passing and his father’s disappearance. 
The house itself was modest, one of the smallest on the street. What made the property valuable was the workshop. It was almost as big as the house. Ren remembers many nights spent watching his father work his craft. Ren learned a lot just by observation. Even more when his father finally agreed to teach him.
Ren smacked his cheeks in unison to jolt himself awake. It would be another long night. His latest design was giving him some trouble and he had a hard time resting when his mind was fluttered with ideas. Ren held his tools and observed the bullet through a magnifying lens. A nearby monitor was connected to his Crystal and it displayed some plans that Ren had previously drafted. It’s glow and the light from a small spot lamp where Ren worked were the only sources of light in the room. Ren began to slowly etch runes into the bullet. He would then need to fill these runes with liquidized Crystal, but he needed to focus on the etching first, any small mistake would mean wasted materials and time.
The shop was set up into three separate rooms. The first was mostly for storing supplies, metals, gunpowder, magical components. Ren had also turned it somewhat into this living space. There was a bed in one corner and a small kitchen in another. He rarely went into the house anymore if he could avoid it.
The second room was the forge. Real hot, all the time. Shelving along every wall, filled with more supplies. The forge was set up right in the middle of the room. Large exhaust shoots leading up through the ceiling. Ren tried his hand at forging knives, swords and other tools with some success. But in his line of work these mundane blades were considered no better than a butter knife. At least his bullets could pack a punch if need be.
Any audit that turned violent would need to be resolved with with magic. Everyone and their grandmothers had a Crystal these days and auditors had to be prepared to fight off all kinds of spells. Although generally the low level wizards like Ren never had to go into any real danger. That was reserved for the higher ups, another reason Ren didn’t mind staying away from the Tower.
The night went on and Ren continued to work, he scrapped a couple bullets but his success rate for etchings was over fifty percent. Ren's work desk was a large U shape that covered all three doorless walls. The room itself was rather large, but it appeared smaller due to the clutter. Ren hadn’t kept things very organized, but he knew where most things were. That or they’d turn up eventually.
Bulletcraft was Ren's true passion. Nothing else in this life made him feel alive. When he got into that special zone of focus, he could work for hours without even realizing that time was passing at all. To observe him in this state was akin to watching the waves hitting the beach, or the clouds rolling over the sky. He was totally immersed into the universe, in a trance like state. He loved it, he lived for it. Testing out the bullets at a range was fun, he’d even sold a few off once or twice, but for Ren nothing compared to the craft.
Ren found peace in simply making the bullets, infusing them with magical properties, using his creativity to design new and powerful bullets. He could create bullets that bounced off surfaces, or bullets that exploded on impact. Some bullets could turn round corners, others could disappear only to show up later behind the target. Some of Ren's favorite bullets were his elementals. The ice one in particular tickled his fancy. 
The materials were rare, he found himself searching dark shops, and interacting with questionable characters just to get leads. Ren may have been cowardly when it came to auditing, but his courage shined when he was looking for new components. He used old alchemical texts for inspiration, witches’ journals, hermit scrolls, you name it. Ren could extract formulas and ingredients from various spells and potions to create nearly any kind of effect he imagined. He was surely talented, his father had told him many times, and Ren's results confirmed it now.
However despite all his talent and experience, he could never recreate the greatest bullet of all; The Golden Bullet. 
Ren was told that these were legendary magic bullets created long ago and that he should protect them at all costs. The Golden Bullets were famous in the bullet crafting world and to an extent a portion of the general population too as myth or legend. Wars had once been fought to obtain a single one, and now Ren supposedly had three. His father had left them behind when he disappeared. He hadn't decided if he believed that these were the real deal or not, but years have passed since then and he has yet to test even one of the bullets. He didn’t know what they did, just that they were supposedly world changing.
It was a quiet night, the cries of the city had already begun to lessen into slumber. Ren was rolling one of the Golden Bullets between his fingers, contemplating new ideas. Sketches and notes littered the table in front of him. He was lost in the zone of focus, staring at everything and nothing all at once.
Suddenly there was a knock on the door at the far side of the workshop. Ren wasn’t entirely sure he had actually heard any knocking at all or if the drowsiness was playing tricks on him. Ren wasn't expecting company, he never expected company, especially not at this hour. He hadn't even considered getting out of his chair yet, when he heard a terrible sound of a smashing of a door, his door. Ren's eyes widened and sprung into action, that door was still two rooms over, he had time.
He fumbled for some of the bullets lying around his work table. He could hear heavy footsteps, they shook the whole workshop with every step. Ren found the bullets he wanted very quickly, but not his gun. He would have cursed his lack of organization but the sound of a second door bursting open made him lose that train of thought, and regain focus on the present danger.
Ren's fear immediately rose and he remembered that the inner door hadn’t been locked. “The bastard didn’t even check!” 
Just then Ren noticed his gun belt hanging off the side of the work table. He leaped toward it, tumbling to the floor. He grabbed his gun out of the belt, then popped the revolving cylinder open. It had three slots and Ren's hands nervously began loading in bullets. He dropped several in the process, but managed to get two in fairly quickly.
He could hear those powerful footsteps, approaching methodically. The steps sounded metallic against his concrete floors. They stopped right before the final door. 
Ren noticed he still had the Golden Bullet in hand. A thought came to his mind that this may be his last chance to find out if these things were real or not. He loaded the Golden Bullet into the final chamber and rotated it to be his first shot. When he flipped the cylinder closed, he suddenly became calm. 
He felt powerful, could it be the Golden Bullet or maybe just the adrenaline rush kicking in. Ren didn’t have time to decide. Ren lifted his arm towards the doorway, he was still on his ass in the corner of the room but he was ready for whatever might come through. There was a moment of silence. In the distance he could hear the train zooming by. The door knob jittered.
“So now he tries the door.” Ren scoffed and then he cocked his gun, ready to see what the Golden Bullet had to offer.
Ren wasn’t too shocked when a hulking suit of armour came bursting through the door. At first Ren wasn’t exactly sure what he was looking at. It looked like some power armour he’d seen before but it was heavily modified. The intruder had two swords at his side. Although both the armour and the swords were of a modern design, Ren still appreciated the craftsmanship.
Ren's attention snapped to the present when he realized that he had spent too much time gawking at the craftsmanship, he shouldn’t have given the intruder so much time to act. He stabilized his hand and aimed his gun at the intruder's chest. 
The intruder however seemed to be frustrated. Ren cocked his eyebrow trying to understand what he was seeing. The suit of armour, and the intruder inside it, was stomping its feet and shaking its fists, one of which was still holding the door knob. The door had been shattered and the pieces lay on the floor, but it looked as though that wasn’t the intruder’s intention. 
The armour was nearly two meters tall and covered the entirety of the intruder’s body. But these newer models still allowed for the optimum mixture of mobility and defense. The adrenaline was still pumping hard in Ren's brain. He could barely think and he couldn’t stop himself from standing up and shouting, “Get the fuck out of here! I’m warning you.” Ren's gaze was strong, but his hands were weak. The armour stopped mid stomp and turned slowly to face him. One arm began moving up towards the intruder’s head. 
Ren yelled another warning, “I said stop!”
The hand continued calmly upward and then tapped a button at the side of the helmet. The face plate lifted upward, collapsing and then resting on top of the intruder’s head. The face inside spoke to Ren calmly with a dry and high pitched voice.
“No, you told me to leave, not to stop.” It was the voice of an Arborian. His short green foliage-like hair would have given it away if the bark-like skin hadn’t already. Ren hadn’t interacted with many Arborians. On the rare occasion that he did see one they always seemed to be so reserved, not unlike everyone else in this city Ren supposed.
“Umm, yeah... I guess.” Ren's confidence was fading quickly and he lowered his gun. He was still ready to use it, but somehow the tension had faded. 
The invading Arborian looked at a monitor attached to his arm and spoke once more, “There’s no black magic.” He seemed genuinely surprised. Arborians had a hard time being anything other than genuine. “But that doesn’t mean we are in the clear.”
Ren suddenly remembered that this was still an intruder situation and pulled his gun upward again. “Why are in my shop?”
The Arborian stopped looking around for a moment and seemed to notice Ren and the gun pointed at him for the first time. His eyes lit up with excitement. “Woah man, does that thing shoot bullets? Classic!”
Ren was lost for a few moments. He steadied his aim with his free hand and regained his resolve.
The Arborian raised an eyebrow. “You don’t think that a simple metal slug can penetrate this armour do you? Do you know how power armour works? It’s more than just metal, it’s infused with the arcane. It’ll stop any simple projectile.”
Ren cracked a smile, the Golden Bullet was no simple projectile. But if they weren’t real he’d be in big trouble. His magic bullets could do some damage to modern power armour, but rotating the cylinder now would make him give up his advantage. Failing to kill this guy would only make him mad. 
Ren's mind wandered for a moment when he realized this must have been the tallest Arborian ever, usually they don’t get far above a meter at tallest. He didn’t dwell on it, and tightened his trigger finger. “I don’t want any trouble, if you leave now we can forget all about this.” He was hoping he still looked at least somewhat threatening.
“I’ll be asking the questions here, sir!” The Arborian really exaggerated the last word and it hit at Ren's funny bone. Something about the voice’s pitch rising even higher. “Now tell me what you’ve been up to, sneaking around my property, being all suspicious like.”
Ren quickly realized just how mistaken he had been earlier. It wasn’t a green mage that lived in that house, but a craftsman like himself.
“Oh geez, man. I’m sorry, I’m actually an auditor. I was checking out a power spike at your place on my way home from work. I assumed you were just a green mage from the tree out front.”
“Oh, you liked the tree? Some of my finest work, it’s actually a guardian.” The Arborian had dropped most of his caution and the armour started to whir and buzz. Bolts spun, plates shifted and the whole chest cavity began to open up revealing a normal sized Arborian inside an over sized suit of armour. 
The magical arrays surrounding the intruder’s arms and legs inside the armour vanished as he hopped out of his seat. A little step ladder ejected from the waist to the ground, serving to prop the power armour. Presumably he was supposed to use the little ladder but his agility was far beyond that.
Ren questioned, “Wait that tree is a fake? It looked so real.”
The Arborian responded, “You haven’t been around many trees I take it? It’s actually somewhat based off of real genetic material and created as an exoskeleton for my sensory equipment to keep it hidden and protected.”
Ren thought this was a genius idea, but had other questions. “I really wasn’t expecting to see an Arborian. Let alone one covered in power armour. Aren’t you forbidden from using our technology?”
“That’s a normal misconception. Most of my people follow the old ways and refuse this new magic. That’s why they all live out in the shitty woods.” Beedel replied as he looked around the shop in awe. “But I love the stuff.”
“I had no idea.” Ren commented.
The Arborian continued, “Most humans don’t know much about us, but uh, sorry about your doors. I thought you were trying to stop my research. I’m Beedel by the way, Beedel Circuitwood.”
Ren sighed some relief. “I’m Ren and I can fix them later. Do you drink tea?”
Beedel was well on his way snooping around the workshop. Ren didn’t mind, his fatigue was setting in now that the adrenaline was fading. 
Beedel casually responded “Yes, Honey Leaf, if you have it.”
Beedel followed up with a compliment, “Your shop here is quite a wonder to behold.”
“Thank you, I spend most of my time in here now days.” Ren felt some pride to be complemented. “Is that a Phoenix MK4? But modded right?”
“Good eye, most don’t recognize it anymore.” Beedel responded as he continued looking around. “I’ve swapped out the thrusters from an old 67’ SunDevil.” 
“Shut up. That was my Dad’s favourite Armour.”
Beedel smiled, “The man has good taste.”
Ren felt prideful as he walked to the doorway. It had been so long since he’d thought about his father fondly. “Milk or sugar?” His hand instinctively reached for the knob that was now laying on the floor and then he paused, gazing at the knob for just a moment before moving on.
