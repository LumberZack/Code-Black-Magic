About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “ADE E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on Windows.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>Quitting Time</Title>
            <Synopsis>Ben takes on one last job before the end of his shift. Carson taunts him. Julia gives a heartfelt goodbye, as she heads to HQ</Synopsis>
            <Text>Ren didn’t hate his job. Being a power auditor for the largest arcane energy distributor on the continent has its perks. Ren thought so at least. The Wizard Association has been good to him. They provided paid training in the arcane arts as well as many other benefit. Ren took quick advantage of the training, but what Ren didn’t like, was that everything boiled down to how to better serve the company. He sighed at the thought and prepared for his final scan of the night.
	“Everything alright there Renny?” Carson lifted his head above Ren's monitor.
“Don’t call me that.” Ren growled.
“Easy now. Ren.” Carson replied. “These are not the qualities of a wizard who aims for the Tower.”
“What do you know of my aims?” Ren inquired.
Carson paused for a moment at Ren's reply. Ren refused eye contact and continued tapping on his Crystal to appear busy, what Carson couldn’t see was that Ren was only shuffling around his Crystal’s various windows to kill time while the scan made progress.
“Every wizard aims for the Tower Renny.” Carson scowled. 
Magic was far from a hot commodity these days, as almost everyone was using the raw energy of the universe to perform menial tasks like their laundry. Being a wizard meant little in the grand scheme of things. 
	Ren, along with most wizards, lived in the city of Novos. The capital of the advanced world. Arcane technology spread its way across the continent like a cancer. Centuries have passed since the days when sorceries were hoarded and kept hidden from the world. Once the secret techniques were broken down and formalized, anyone with a bit of patience could learn the ultimate art of creation and destruction. Those who did were called wizards. 
Carson was about to speak once more when a shrill voice cut through the drone of the small room, “Carson! Where’s that report?” Carson jumped back from Ren's desk and left without another word.
Ren looked up to see his supervisor, Stephen, impatiently waiting for Carson. Ren's attention returned to his work. The scan was nearing completion, no anomalies in Ren's sector. Ren cracked his neck and stretched out his back. It was almost quitting time.
“Well I’m done for the night.” She spoke directly to Ren. “Sector 7 is all clear.”
Ren turned to face Julia. She was smiling at him. 
“So, that’s it then?” Ren sputtered out.
“I’m afraid so.” Julia smiled earnestly. “I’m gonna miss it here.”
“No you won’t.” Ren laughed. “The Wizard Tower is gonna be great. You’ve earned this promotion.”
Julia blushed, “It’s just reception.”
“It’s your foot in the door.” Ren countered.
“You might get your own foot in that door soon.” Julia added.
“I don’t know, I’m happy here.” Ren replied.
“Yeah, sure Ren.” Julia laughed as she glanced towards Carson and Stephen on the other side of the room.
“I am, you know.” Ren encouraged. “The Tower is… Too much responsibility...”
The Wizard Tower, the headquarters for all of the Wizard Association. The Wizard Association unofficially controlled the city. There were biannual elections for the city’s chancellor, but even if the people voted in the chancellor, the flow of energy was directly tied to the flow of power.
The Wizard Association provides free energy to all citizens of Novos on one condition; The energy cannot be used for code black magic. Magic is divided into several coded styles, each linked to a colour. Black being any of the immoral stuff like killing people or raising the dead. 
The usage rates were tracked directly by the handheld catalytic devices known as Crystals and the whole system was monitored by auditors, like Ren. If any abnormal patterns emerged the auditors launch an investigation to determine the source of the anomaly. Fighting off any non-cooperatives if necessary. 
It wasn’t a glamorous job, in fact most citizens had a high degree of disrespect for any auditors. It was a reasonable reaction considering if an auditor was coming for a visit it usually meant that you were in trouble.
“Ren.” Julia pointed towards his Crystal’s window.
Ren turned to see the alert, the one and only, “I should get that.”
“You should.” She said.
They shared a silent moment of uncertainty.
“Maybe I’ll see you around.”
“Maybe.”
Ren turned his chair back. Julia walked away.
Ren didn’t mind the work or even the public’s hate. It was the busy work he needed and company like Julia’s made the hours bearable. He would miss her.
“Let’s see what we got.” Ren said to himself. He channeled a spell on his Crystal to check the signal. “Fuck.” It was a big one, not alarming, but not small enough to ignore either. 	
“Probably just some minor black magic.” Ren rolled his eyes. Officially code black magic was criminalized to protect the people, and in the extreme cases that was true. But being an auditor Ren knew that unofficially, anything that could interfere with the Wizard Association was classified as black magic.
Ren placed a hold on the signal and stood up. His supervisor Stephen was on the other side of the room, Carson stood nearby while Stephen read over the report on his own Crystal. Ren called out, “Hey, Stephen.” Stephen’s attention was grabbed without a response. “I got a small one in sector 8, I’ll check it out on my way home and call in if I get anything.”
“That’s fine Ren.” And Stephen was back to work on Carson’s report.
Without another word Ren selected the signal again, copied down the details into his Crystal and filed it as resolved. He collected his things, canceled all active work related spells on his Crystal, and got up to leave.
Ren couldn’t be bothered to wait for the lift, so he skipped down the stairs, three flights to the ground floor and exited through a side door. The night air was crisp, Ren cherished the sensation on his skin. 
The Wizard Tower loomed over the city, arcane power flowing upward from its structure. It is uncontested as the largest structure on the continent. Ren stood in awe for just a moment. No matter how many times he’d seen it, the Tower had a way of capturing his attention. There were several orders of magnitude of difference between the Wizard Tower and Ren's office. Ren took a deep breath of fresh air and began walking.
He went the usual way home, along the busier streets filled with glowing arcane signs. Ren dared not to wander too much at this time, or anytime for that matter. The city hungered for action and Ren didn’t want to be the fuel to that fire. Novos was his home, but Ren knew not to go looking for trouble. The capital city had grown a great deal in a short time. Ren learned quickly that most folk were better off avoided.
Although he was a Wizard, many could make the same claim. An auditor was one of the safer jobs for a Wizard, but Ren had more than a few close calls regardless.
The sun had set and the nightlife of Novos was just getting started. As Ren walked, the streets were full of folk busy with their own lives. Some were leaving parties, others on their way to parties. Nearly everyone had their eyes fixed on their Crystals. A tool of such power being used for the most trivial of tasks left a foul taste in Ren's mouth. Novos was a hard city. Barely any signs of nature were around except for very few ratpigeons. There was also the occasional Arborian, if you could count them as nature.
It was the promise of free energy that brought so many to Novos. It had been overcrowded years ago, and has since continued to grow in population. Now more than ever people had all the power and technology they could ever need, but they’ve been cut off from each other, from community. Drugs were rampant, killing thousands each year. Theft, murder, rape, and kidnappings were at an all time high, but most barely batted an eyelash. A cold city.
The rest of his walk home didn’t take much time at all. He was almost home when he made an off-shoot to check out the source of the signal. Ren hoped it would be a false alarm.
It wasn't too uncommon for one of these anomalies to be related to black magic. Usually only minor situations like someone trying to curse a neighbor or revive a dead pet. They knew it was illegal, and they could be cut off from the power supply or worse, but people still tried to get away with it. Resurrection was of course the big one, and you couldn’t even attempt something like that without a huge amount of power. It rarely worked when attempted anyway. 
Many wizards will tap into the city’s power supply to perform greater feats of magic. The smart ones try to hide their presence, only using a small amount of energy at a time to not be caught by the auditors. The not-so-smart, or maybe desperate ones sometimes go all out; drawing as much power from the grid as possible to cast their magic as quickly as possible. This usually ends poorly. 
As Ren approached the source of the signal, he noticed the small tree on the front lawn, not much taller than himself. 
“The house with a tree, really?” Ren joked. “At least it’s not a cat. Probably just one of those brain fried green mages.”
Cats caused a large majority of the false alarms. For some reason, the energy flow is just weird around cats. They don’t have to do anything except be near the machinery to cause an issue and usually they did more than that.
Ren crossed the street to get a closer look at the building. Although the tree was small, Ren was still pleased to observe it. Trees were a rarity in Novos. He examined the it carefully, and grazed his finger along its trunk. 
It shocked him quite fiercely in return. Ren shook his finger, grimaced, and moved on. A little less impressed with the tree now.
Ren checked around the house and scanned the power meter with his Crystal. There didn’t seem to be a constant intake, nor was there any suspicious manifestations in the area. That led Ren to the conclusion that this was indeed the work of a green mage. “Damn herbalists.” Ren said, “I bet they have a cat too.”
Ren turned away from the house and began heading home, his dwelling beckoned to him and his hobby awaited his attention. Ren felt as though he had done a good job as he walked away unaware of the peering eyes watching him as he went.

            <Title>Bloody Saviour</Title>
            <Text>Grummin’s dreams had been full of terrors. Each feeling more real than the last. He saw multiple instances of Corina stealing blood from his body with her wicked devices. He also glimpsed her doing the same to her chimera, Whiskers.
	Blood was a source of power in many kinds of magic. Grummin was no expert of magical practices, but he knew enough to stay away from any kind of magic that dealt with blood. His nightmares included roden being torn to shreds from the perspective of the killer, blood being injected into him, and the shrieking laughter of his capture. 
	The last image Grummin saw before his sudden awakening was the eyes of the chimera. They were staring directly into his from a distance much too close for comfort. The chimera’s eyes were glowing with a darkened red energy. At first it was horrifying but then Grummin could see something more. Pain. 
	He awoke, covered in cold sweat, still shackled to the wall. Grummin was surprised to see that the inside of the cave was calm and that he still had all of his limbs. He half expected his head would be sewn onto the chimera’s body. But it wasn’t. For now, he feared.
	Grummin scanned the room and noticed that Corina was sleeping peacefully in the far corner. Curled up into a ball laying on the padding she likely called her bed. 
In the other corner opposite to him, he saw the chimera, Whiskers. It was looking directly at him as if to say hello. It seemed much more amicable than it had before. Whisker’s lion head cocked to one side in a curious fashion. It seemed to be considering something. 
Grummin was no longer afraid and maintained direct eye contact with the beast. The deep red glow of it’s eyes from his dream had made the beast seem like a creature made from pure evil. But now in the ambient green light of glowing mushrooms the chimera’s eyes were warm. 
	Grummin started to realize that the chimera might not be as monstrous as he first thought. Grummin began to wonder what happened to all the minds of the combined creatures. Did they fight for dominance over the body, or were the minds just as mangled as the bodies were. However distorted they might be, Grummin believed there was awareness in those eyes. Whiskers was far more than an order obeying machine.
	Suddenly Whiskers broke their eye contact and looked towards the entrance tunnel. There was no door, simply and long dark hallway that led elsewhere. There was a faint noise, a scraping of metal against rock, moving slowly towards them. The chimera's keen senses had noticed it before Grummin’s, but not by much.
	Whiskers stood up and gave a quiet growl that alerted Corina. She awoke suddenly, speaking half in dream, “Get that crab out of my fish.” Corina shook her head lightly, noticed Whisker's gaze and turned her perceptions towards the entrance without another word. 
After a few moments she spoke. “Good Whiskers, you found a survivor.”
	Grummin was concerned to notice that Corina had regained her aged appearance. Perhaps it was some kind of spell to hide her true self. Grummin wasn’t too sure, but he did know that she shouldn’t be taken lightly. Corina was dangerous.
	She pointed out into the hall, “Fetch.” 
Whisker got up slowly. There was no urgency in the creature’s actions. Spending more than a few moments on stretching. Once done, Whiskers slowly moved forward toward that sound. 
	Suddenly the source of the sound had reached the light of the cave. It was Skeeter. It was a broken, bruised, and bloody Skeeter. He was dragging a small sword on the ground beside him, he could barely lift it. He was also leaning up against the cave wall to support himself. Taking one slow step at a time towards his target.
	Grummin called out to him, “Skeeter turn back!”
	This caught Corina’s attention, she turned and spoke to him in a stern older voice, “I see you’ve awoken, that won’t do.”
	Skeeter however ignored Grummin’s call and marched forward. The man was worn out beyond any hope of success, but there was a determined look in his eye. Fueled by revenge no doubt, but he had an air of power surrounding him. Completely counter intuitive to his visual appearance.
	Skeeter yelled out, not in response to Grummin, not to anyone in general, just out into the world, “They’re all dead!”
	Corina became furious. She yelled out to him nearly straining her voice to do so, “You little brat and I’ll turn you into feed for my pets!”
	Skeeter’s regained some composure before he replied, “Fuck you.” He was clearly trying to make her angry. Grummin’s respect for this roden just kept growing. 
	Corina nearly fell over from the impact of Skeeter’s words. She breathed deeply, clearly trying to avoid Skeeter’s trap to infuriated her. Grummin noticed they battled as if they knew each other. They were the last two surviving roden, and they were about to try and kill each other.
	Corina spoke calmly now, “You will die now, I’ve had just about enough of your interference.” She was doing well to hold down her anger, then she added, “Whiskers, get him.” 
The chimera followed her command. It began striding along ready to pounce. Skeeter pushed his balance off of the wall and firmly onto his two feet. He placed both hands around the hilt of the blade and stood ready to attack.
	The chimera was closing in and Grummin couldn’t bare to watch. He struggled to break free from his shackles but he still felt weak from the chemicals Corina had been dosing him with. As Whiskers got even closer Grummin yelled out, “Stop!”
	Everyone in the room suddenly stopped, including Whiskers. The chimera tilted its head at Grummin, as if to say, now what?
Corina looked to her pet, with rage filling her eyes, “I said attack.” Whiskers simply lowered his head and looked again towards Grummin. Corina screamed, “Don’t look at him, you idiot. I am your master!”
Grummin realized that he and the beast had some kind of bond. The blood transfusions from his visions may have been real. That’s the only explanation Grummin could conceive. It wasn’t a very strong sensation but Grummin could feel Whiskers’s pain. The chimera didn’t want to disobey its master, but it also wanted to listen to Grummin. There was trust in its eyes.
Corina looked over at Grummin who was deep in thought trying to analyze the situation. She cursed herself then thought outloud, “The transfusion is backfiring. I need to sedate him.”
Skeeter however was inching slowly closing to Corina as her back was turned. He wasn’t lucky enough to catch her off guard. She noticed his movements and jumped forward, distancing herself from him. 
“But first I’ll deal with you.” She spoke to Skeeter as if he were merely an insect to be squashed. She pulled out a small knife from under her clothing and a wax puppet. As she walked towards Skeeter she focused her energy into the puppet and it began to glow. The puppet began to move and look around. Corina presented the knife to the puppet and it proceeded to vomit onto the blade. After that her catalyst return to its unanimated state.
The green ooze dripped from the blade as she passed Whiskers. She spoke to her chimera without looking at the beast, “You’ll be next if you don’t start behaving.”
As Corina approached him Skeeter squinted in fear. Grummin noticed this to be strange when just a moment ago Skeeter was holding strong against an approaching chimera that was easily twice his size. Then Grummin saw Skeeter’s grip on the sword had tightened.
Corina got within striking distance and she lifted her knife high into the air. It was covered in that dark green sludge, most likely a dreadful poison. But before she pulled her arm down to strike Skeeter’s face changed. His fear was gone, replaced by a cunning grin. He looked Corina in the eye and spoke softly, Grummin could barely hear him, “Gotcha.” 
With impressive speed, the sword was lifted from its position on the ground to a position high in the air. On its journey between the two spots it had found home in Corina’s flesh and was now covered in her blood.
It wasn’t a deep slice, but her age made her fragile. Any wound could become fatal. She jumped back writhing in pain and shrieking swear words in the roden tongue that Grummin couldn’t translate. She instinctively dropped the knife and placed a hand over her wound.
Skeeter had fully committed himself to that attack. His goal was to cut her in half but he was happy to at least make contact. The sword had been partially holding him up and the aggressiveness of his swing had thrown him off balance. He landed on the floor with a great thud.
Corina turned back and ran to the other side of her cave. As she passed the chimera she yelled at it, “This is your fault you damn beast!” As she spoke she cast a spell over Whiskers using her puppet catalyst. The blast knocked him down, but the spell continued to torment the creature.
Grummin could still feel Whiskers’s pain. Using a hex like that enraged Gummin and the rage returned some of his strength to him. He ripped his shackles out of the wall breaking them in the process.
Skeeter was breathing heavily on the ground, enjoying the view as Corina fled. Whiskers was still rolling in pain. Corina was on her way to the far side of the room. She was running to what appeared to be a dead end. 
As Grummin broke free she reached the back wall of the cave. Corina waved her puppet in the air and it began to glow. The cave wall itself was opened to a downward staircase. She scurried down and as quickly as it opened it had shut behind her.
Skeeter was still prone, but as Grummin looked over towards Whiskers he was compelled to help the beast first. He ran to Whiskers’s side and began calming the chimera, “Shh, it’s alright try to relax.” 
Grummin placed his hands on the creature and in that moment their minds connected. Grummin heard the hundreds of voices within the single body. Grummin understood. Whiskers was the product of many iterations of chimerism. Compared to the small chimera he’d fought. Whiskers was so much more. And to become so, would require constantly undergoing terrible pain and confusion as the different souls and minds tried to find a way to coexist within a single body. 
Grummin feared that had things gone differently Corina may have been attempting to add him to the sea of voices within Whiskers. The blood transfusions made sense then. They were preparations for that and in one way they had worked. Grummin and Whiskers were connected.
This shared experience only took moments but for Grummin it felt much longer. He learned so much about Corina. Her dark experiments. How the she’d been banished by Aizen, the chief of the roden, for using her kin to create her chimeras. 
Then Grummin saw how Krozan had approached her, and suggested a method for revenge. There was another meeting with someone else. Grummin couldn’t get all the details. He was seeing through the chimera’s eyes and the figure was hidden in shadow.
The transfer of thought was a heavy experience. It knocked Grummin down. But thankfully it had calmed Whiskers. Sharing a story with another creature was a naturally calming experience and Grummin knew that Whiskers hadn’t had a lot of chances to communicate with anyone except Corina, who treated him more like a tool than a pet.
Whiskers was recovering and sat up slowly. Skeeter watched in awe. There was a flash of light and the curse placed on the chimera’s mind was gone. Skeeter wasn’t quite sure what just happened between the draconian and the chimera. But he knew that Corina was hurt and now she was on the run.
Grummin needed a moment to recover from that experience. His head throbbed as if a large clock was ticking on the inside of his skull. Grummin suddenly remembered Skeeter was down, he pushed through his pain and stood up.
He was relieved to see that Skeeter was still breathing. But the little guy didn’t look so good. Grummin wanted to help him but he didn’t know where to begin, “Skeeter.” Grummin began as he approached, “Skeeter, how do I help you?” Grummin was looking for a good way to pick him up. He’d never been good at dealing with death and was getting nervous.
“It’s… okay.” Skeeter’s breathing was heavy. “I… did it. That… bitch.”
“Don’t force yourself. Just breathe.” Skeeter took Grummin’s advice. The air was completely silent except for the sound of his rough breaths. Even Whiskers was watching curiously. 
“Thank you… Grummin.” 
“I don’t deserve your gratitude.” Grummin’s guilt was peaking within him. 
“No… Not your... fault. Corina. She… betrayed us…” Skeeter’s anger rose and it made his breathing more difficult again. Grummin turned him over and held him in his arms. For Grummin it was like holding a baby. For Skeeter, he felt that much closer to the afterlife. The comfort of being held helped him rest.
Skeeter struggled to capture a few more breaths then he continued, “No… guilt… just go. You’re not... dead... yet. Avenge… us.” Slowly Skeeter’s eyes lost focus. Grummin could feel his little heart giving out. He said nothing while Skeeter entered his eternal sleep.
Grummin kept him close in his arms as he stood up. Slowly They left Corina’s cave through the tunneled entrance. Grummin walked slowly as if not to disturb Skeeter’s spirit. His mind was on Skeeter’s words. With his dying breath, Skeeter gave Grummin a mission. 
Grummin would carry it out and when done he’ll begin removing the weeds from the warden ranks.
It didn’t take him long to reach the end of the tunnel. As he suspected it ended in the bottom of the chasm. Here hundreds of rats still lay motionless, frozen in their death. The rot had begun and as Grummin looked upward he could see no flames. It appeared so much time had passed since the battle, but Grummin wondered just how much.
He laid Skeeter’s body down gently beside his kin. Grummin took a moment of silence for all the Roden, and Skeeter especially. Then he turned, calmed his rage and walked back to Corina’s cave. 
As Grummin reached the entrance Whiskers was waiting patiently for him with a joyful expression. It was an odd looking face. Grummin found it endearing. Sort of like seeing an old friend after a long parting.
Grummin nodded to his new companion. Whiskers got up and began prowling around the room. Grummin watched as Whiskers seemed to sniff around the room. The behaviour was very dog-like, kind of surprising to Grummin considering Whiskers’ outward appearance was mostly that of a cat. But as Grummin recalled his visions, he remembered that didn’t mean very much in the world of chimerism. 
Grummin ignored Whiskers for now and walked over to the low table on the far side of the room. The only piece of his armour he had left was a single gauntlet. “It’ll have to do.” Grummin grabbed the gauntlet and returned it to it’s proper home, on his arm. He wondered if the rest of his armour had been left in the Roden city or if Krozan might’ve found it.
Whiskers stopped around where Corina’s blood had spilled. Grummin realized he was sniffing in an effort to gain her scent. Grummin realized their goals seemed to align. Seek and destroy. 
Grummin walked up to the secret passage. He couldn’t find any kind of lever or switch. It may be only openable by magic, magic Grummin didn’t know.  Whiskers wandered towards that end of the cave too.
Grummin looked Whiskers in the eye and realized they could communicate without words when Whiskers moved a safe distance from the wall and sat down to observe. They understood each other perfectly. Grummin took a deep breath a charged his gauntlet. He might not know much about magic but Grummin knew a lot about making doors where there were none previously. 
His gauntlet glowed with an array of red light. Then suddenly with lightning speed, Grummin’s right arm launched forward and crashed through the wall. The blast was enough to knock Grummin back a few steps, he had overcharged slightly but the blast was very effective. The wall was destroyed. It now revealed the same dark staircase that Corina had used to flee. 
Whiskers returned to Gummin’s side. Grummin’s gaze was fixed downward into the darkness. He would find Corina, Krozan and whoever the other player was in this twisted game. He would make them all pay for their crimes. He will avenge the roden and save the wardens.
Even though he knew the words were unnecessary, Grummin spoke to Whiskers, “Let’s go.” Whiskers followed as they both began their descent into the unknown lower tunnels.

            <Title>The Long Way Home</Title>
            <Text>Beedel, Ren, and the unconscious Umbra encountered  very little resistance on their journey to the Great Wood. Ren was anxious to arrive so someone could treat the wounded lady. Beedel had been awfully quiet during the trip. Most of his attention was on getting them safely out of the city.
Umbra had stirred several times since their trip began, but she never regained enough consciousness to communicate. Against Beedel’s advice Ren had detached his safety harness to go back and check on her wounds. 
	They had left the dense city core and were part way through the suburban area. Beedel sighed a bit of relief. “I think we’re in the clear.”
Ren returned to his seat. “You think so?”
“We’re far enough away now. Yeah.” Beedel smiled. “So tell me about your bullets.”
Ren was pleased to, “Well I infuse them with liquid crystal etchings and they make for a fun couple of hours at the range.”
“They’re so intricate. Seems like a lot of work for a single bullet.” Beedel noted.
“It can be. But I can use the more than once.” Ren smiled. “They work like a crystal that only has a single spell. I charge energy into the catalyst, in this case the bullet and the effect triggers.” 
“That’s clever Renny.” Beedel replied. “Then you must be a pretty good shot with that thing, eh?”
“Quite the opposite.” Ren answered.
Beedel gave Ren a confused look. 
“My dad tried teaching me. He could shoot.” Ren remembered. “But I couldn’t quite get it. The spells I use make hitting targets much easier.” Ren fiddled with his gun as he spoke.
“Then why use the gun?” Beedel asked.
“It helps focus the spell’s effect in a single direction. And the cylinder helps me change spells quickly.” Ren began to open the cylinder on his gun to show Beedel some examples.
“Very clever indeed.”
“Thanks.” Ren replied. As he got the cylinder open that’s when he noticed the golden bullet sitting inside. Ren suddenly realized that he had two more stashed away in his workshop. He was quite certain Beedel hadn’t found them. Because he’d left the other two in the compartment under his desk. They were easily the most beautifully designed bullets, Beedel would definitely had asked a question specifically about them. 
Just as Ben was about to ask if they could return for the other two golden bullets the car hit a bump in the road. This bounced them all lightly into the air. The gun’s cylinder voided it’s contents into Ren’s lap.
	Beedel’s eye caught a glimpse of the golden bullet, “That’s a lovely one. What does it do?”
	Ren froze for a moment. The golden bullets were legendary. Ren had never shared with anyone that he had been given three of them and he also didn’t have proof that they were the real deal. He didn’t want to look like a fool nor did he want to lie to Beedel. 
Ren decided the half truth would have to do for now. “This is one of the bullets my father passed down to me before he went missing.”
	“Oh! So Silver gave that to you?” Bedel interrupted with a sudden interest. “It must be quite powerful.”
	“You knew my father?” Ren responded with his own curiosity.
	“Of course Renny. Your father is a hero to my people. If it wasn’t for his effort we might not have survived and the Great Wood would be no more.” Beedel smirked.
	“What can you tell me about him? Do you know where he is?” Ren's curiosity burned brighter with every word Beedel spoke. 
	“Well I didn’t know him personally, but you’re about to meet someone who did. I’m sure he’ll have more answers for you.” Beedel replied.
	Ren thought about this for a moment considering what he’d do when and if he saw his father again. Beedel became quiet to let Ren think. Ren was only interrupted from these thoughts as he heard his rescued maiden moan from the back of the vehicle. His attention quickly returned to the present. Looking back towards her he noticed her stirrings had become more lucid. Not quite awake, but she was getting there.
	Ren directed Beedel’s attention to her and Beedel responded confidently, “Good timing.” They were just now reaching the apex of a large hill and on the horizon slowly inching upward was the canopy of a very large forest. Beedel continued, “We’re home Renny.”

            <Title>BugBot's Adventure  Vol. 2</Title>
            <Text>BugBot was enjoying a nice drink of raw energy from a small conductor tube that lined the tunnels. The little robot had travelled far since the fiasco with Stephen and Carson. BugBot suspected that those two would still be after him. But BugBot’s energy levels were quite low so he had stopped for a few moments to recharge, pulling energy directly from the grid.
	BugBot was supposed to gather information from the inside of Ren's office building. Being closer to the Wizard Tower and the center of all the magical power in the city would allow BugBot to analyze the data with much more efficiently. That plan had failed.
	Luckily Beedel had designed BugBot with the ability to consider options and make judgements on the fly. He considered abandoning his mission. He also considered heading back to Ren’s office. The latter had little chance of success. He could likely find another terminal in a nearby building, but that would take time. His pursuers would be after him sending word to nearby wizard office. BugBot didn’t have time to search blindly. 
	Finally BugBot decided to send a distress signal to Beedel. Before he could commit to the idea BugBot picked up some noise coming from a nearby tunnel. It was a soft echo at first, but with time he could decipher the sound more clearly. BugBot decided to investigate, cautiously.
	BugBot scuttled down the tunnel, upside down attached to the ceiling. As he approached the next corridor he stopped and huddled up into the shadows around the corner. The footsteps were now very close, heading his way. It was two sets of footwork. 
Before they were in sight, BugBot could overhear part of their conversation. One voice sounded deep and grizzled, it spoke with respect towards the other voice. The second voice was a soft voice with a forced kindness, as if the speaker didn’t care much to put up with the other one, but did so out of necessity.
	The calm voice was the first within discernible distance, “By the looks of your face, it seems the rats put up quite the fight. What happened to a unanimous victory?”
	“The fucking rats weren’t the problem.” This voice belonged to a Draconian. “It was actually one of our own. The son of Bezelnorf.” The grizzly voice tried to explain itself. “That bastard did this to me.”
	“I see. And did you deal with him?” The voice remained calm.
	“He’s no longer a problem.”
	“Excellent Krozan! Now we move on to phase three.” The speaker finally displayed some emotion. 
	“Didn’t you fail to acquire the artifact?” Krozan questioned trying to remain respectful. The two speakers had now come into view. It was immediately clear which voice belonged to which figure, or at least it would have been quite shocking had BugBot’s assessment been wrong. It wasn’t.
	Krozan’s face was covered in bandages. Everything except a single eye was wrapped up and the wrappings needed to be changed. Krozan walked with a limp, but it was a slight limp that implied he could still spring into action at any moment.
	The second figure was much smaller. Human, but small for human standards. BugBot had recently encountered several humans, one of which was quite tall. Stephen would dwarf this figure in height, but BugBot could sense a massive presence from woman. She was dressed in a colourful robe, with a matching pointed hat. She was clearly a wizard, not many chose to dress in the ancient garbs, but it was often the oldest and most powerful wizards who proudly wore the clothes of old.
	The wizard woman was thinking about her response. Krozan began to doubt himself “I didn’t mean to insult you Elizaborah.” 
“Not at all. I did fail. But it is only matter of time until the last artifact is in our hands.” She laughed and it was somewhere between a giggle and a cackle.
	Krozan seemed confused, but laughed along with her anyway. They were now distancing themselves from the corridor BugBot hid within. However BugBot was still watching and listening intently. A powerful wizard could lead BugBot to a terminal even closer to the source then Ren's office. BugBot jumped at the opportunity and slowly followed the two conspirators ready to run at any moment should he be discovered.

            <Title>The Witch's Lair</Title>
            <Text>Some amount of time had passed, but Grummin couldn’t tell how much. The poison had not knocked him out but he kept briefly waking to glimpses of horrifying imagery. One vision was of Corina the Witch Roden taking blood from his arm. Another was her chimera unleashing all its savagery upon her, leaving only a bloody mess where she once stood. 
Grummin concluded that the last one was probably a hallucination, because he could now see Corina, her back to him as she stirred a large bubbling cauldron. The cauldron was almost as big as she was and made from dark cast iron. Corina needed to perch herself on a small step ladder to get high enough to stir effectively.
Grummin was feeling much then he’d been just after the fall. He noticed he’d be chained to the wall, but didn’t pay much attention to that just yet. As Grummin looked around the room he presumed he was inside Corina’s home. It had an almost cozy feel to it. The cave walls here didn’t have the same smoothness as those in the roden city. They were rough cuts. Many claw marks were visible around the walls, Grummin knew that those claws would have to be quite sharp to cut through the solid rock here. 
There was plenty of light, most of which came from the fire underneath the cauldron, however there was also various points of green luminescence coming from some mushrooms scattered throughout the room.
The room was also cluttered with bizarre objects. Roden feet dangled from the ceiling, bones scattered all over the place, and more than a few eyeballs in various jars. Grummin shuddered as he remembered she was most likely the last surviving roden. 
Grummin’s mind returned to the present and he noticed something bizarre in his body. It felt too good. He could tell that his leg muscles were still damaged but they were healing quickly and overall his body felt in prime condition. Grummin wondered if he was asleep for longer than he thought and if she’d been tending to his wounds.
The chimera was laying in the corner of the room on a pile of bones and fur. Grummin’s alertness had caught it’s attention. The chimera sat up and made a deep rolling roar in its gut. This got Corina’s attention. 
As she looked over towards Grummin, his heart sank. He wasn’t looking at the elderly roden he had seen in the chasm. She was much younger. She grinned a large grin and it was simultaneously calming and disturbing to Grummin. She slowly moved from her step ladder and walked towards him.
Grummin’s nerves were standing on edge, every battle instinct was telling him to fight or flee. Flee seemed the better option but getting out of his shackles with that chimera sitting in wait wouldn’t end well. Grummin decided to speak up, “Corina?”
She seemed happy to hear the name and replied, “Yes, my dear.”
“Did you heal my wounds?” 
“Well yes of course, we couldn’t leave a strong warden like you in such a broken state.”
The kindness was troubling. Grummin was trying to figure out her objective. Did she think he was one of Krozan’s men, if so why was she being so kind.
“Why am I chained?” Grummin was trying to play dumb, maybe he could get information from Corina.
“Because, my dear, you became quite violent during your treatment.” Grummin had a vision of his blood being extracted and her aged face filled with sinister intent. Corina continued, “But it shouldn’t be long now until you’re all fixed up.”
	The chains holding Grummin were awfully short. His mobility was quite limited, he wouldn’t be able to scratch his own nose in this position. He was sitting upright against the wall. He noticed many other chains along this wall. It was like a small dungeon, each set of chains getting smaller as they went, to accommodate prisoners of all sizes. 
	Grummin needed more information, “Why did you bring me here?”
	“I told you already, to fix you.” Corina was returning to her cauldron, it was beginning to boil over.
	“But why drug me?”
	“To ease your pain, I’m afraid my medicine might not be as refined as the stuff you are used to on the upper levels. But it’ll do the job.” Grummin was caught by the comment about upper levels. Did she mean the tunnels? As far as the wardens were concerned there was only a few levels to the tunnels and no one referred to them as upper in any way.
	“Where are we now?” Grummin asked.
	“You took a long fall down the pit. It’s fortunate that your injuries were so mild.” She smiled.
	Grummin was getting that sinking feeling again. “But why do you live down here?”
	Corina gave him a suspicious eying. Grummin knew he needed to slow down his questioning, but she answered him anyway, “A little falling out with our Chief. His old ways of doing things disapproved of my research. Research that could help us evolve.”
	“You mean the chimeras?”
	“Among other things.” She sent another puzzled look towards him. “Didn’t Krozan explain anything to you boys?”
	Grummin nearly lost it. That was confirmation enough for him that Krozan was behind all of this. He neede to escape and confront his uncle, but first he’d go along with Corina for now. 
“No, he doesn’t tell us much beyond orders.” A lot of contempt slipped out.
	“That does sound like Krozan Irontooth.” Corina seemed convinced.
	There was a long pause, the only sounds in the cave were the roaring of the flames and the bubbling of the cauldron.
	Grummin took a few deep breaths to calm himself. Then he began, “My leg is feeling much better. How much longer do you think until I can head back to the upper levels.” 
	Corina pondered her answer as she gave the cauldron a slow stir. “I don’t think it’ll be as soon as you like.” Corina chuckled quietly to herself, it terrified Grummin. “You’ll need more time to rest. You feel so good because of the medicine, you’re body is still quite damaged.” 
	“Oh.” Grummin was conflicted he felt like if he got out of the chains he’d be able to walk around, maybe even run without much trouble.
	Corina added, “You’ll have to stay with us for quite some time.”
	“Us?” Grummin just noticed her use of the plural pronoun.
	Corina laughed lightly to herself once more, “Yes, Whiskers and I have been longing for some company.” 
Grummin assumed she meant the chimera. “Could I at least get released from these chains?”
Corina’s laughter was not quiet this time. It startled Whiskers. Then she added, while trying to catch her breath, “I’m afraid not dear, Whiskers has a terrible temper towards guests who aren’t chained up. You’re best left exactly where you are.”
This was far from the answer Grummin wanted. He was hoping to trick Corina into letting him go. But that didn’t seem very likely now. He could easily break through these chains but then he’d have to contend with that beast known as Whiskers. 
Grummin wasn’t confident that he could handle the chimera without his power armour. He’d fought many back when defending the warden command centre, but those were small critters compared to this beast. 
As Grummin scanned the room he did see that one of his gauntlets was laying on the table between Corina and her pet. It would be risky to rush for it. Grummin decided to wait for now. Corina could be telling the truth about the medicine giving him false confidence. Once he was sure his leg was fully healed he would make his move. Besides what did he have to rush for now. The roden were dead.
Grummin pushed the negativity away and found a reason to smile. If his enemy wanted to heal his wounds, he’d let her.
Corina finished stirring and claimed down her ladder just in time to noticed Grummin’s smile fade as they made eye contact. Grummin considered her youthful appearance and was sure that she had appeared much older before she had drugged him.
“It is time for your medicine again.” She pulled out a cloth from her pocket and snatched a small vial of clear liquid from a nearby table. 
“No.” Grummin pleaded. “I’m really feeling better.”
She wet the cloth lightly as she walked towards Grummin, “Shush now, I need to concentrate or else I might add too much. Too much would be a problem.” Corina grinned.
Grummin tried to resist her, but the only thing he could do was turn his head. “No I don’t need any more of that.” He desperately tried to convince his captor to stop. “It gives me strange visions. Nightmares!” His head was swinging back and forth trying to avoid letting the cloth reach his mouth.
She replied simply, “They are simply visions, try to relax my sweet.” It was then that she grabbed his face with her long fingers. It was only a matter of time and Grummin knew it. She placed the cloth in front of his mouth swiftly. She only held it there for a few moments, but that’s all it took. Grummin was fading quickly. Just before falling into a deep slumber, he heard Corina speaking.
“You will make a lovely pet.” Her laughter was the last thing he remembered before the darkness came to take him away.

            <Title>Strange Company</Title>
            <Text>“The good thing about wizards,” Beedel said as they neared Ren's lot from the backside, “was that they’re so quick to jump to conclusions.” Beedel made sure he had Ren's attention before continuing, “We can use that.”
Ren was half surprised to see his own house still standing. In the eyes of wizardry Ren was now an accomplice to this crazed Arborian. Ren thanked his luck that Grummin had been sent to escort him. Otherwise things might have gone differently. 
	Ren didn’t respond to Beedel, his mind was now focused on collecting his things from his workshop. First he needed his gun, then he’d collect as many bullets as he could, and finally he thought to grab the golden bullets. They were more of a keepsake of his father than anything else, but Ren was sentimental for that kind of stuff.
Even though some blind birds have better aim with their poo then Ren did with a bullet, he thought it would be smart to at least arm himself. If another fight broke out Ren didn’t want to sit on the sidelines and his crystal infused bullets allowed him to forgo aiming most of the time.
Beedel spoke as if reading Ren's thoughts, “Go and get your guns, be quick Renny.” Beedel hadn’t shared too much information about what the plan was, or where they were going. When Ren had asked him about it, Beedel began explaining but the story tagented. A common quality of Beedel’s storytelling.
Ren was wearing a simple button up shirt with long pants. His usual work attire. A change of clothes would do him good. Ren felt the need to dress up the part of a criminal now, he believed he had some torn jeans somewhere and maybe a leather jacket. 
Ren was mid thought, pre planning his route through the workshop, when his hand made contact with the door knob. As the door swung open, it caught Ren off guard. He vividly recalled locking this door before leaving. 
Ren's fear spiked and he shrieked “Beedel!” 
Ren's new accomplice was right behind him but Beedel didn’t notice any of Ren's fear as he strode over, “Yes?” 
Ren's face was frozen in fear, his eyes were glued to the door knob. Beedel followed the gaze and saw that the door was open. He looked back at Ren, with a squint of his eyes and a few moments of thought later Beedel understood.
Beedel kicked the door in. Miraculously it remained on it’s hinges. He stormed in, swords drawn. Beedel was in battle mode and scanned the room quickly for threats. Beedel was so focused on finding an ambush of enemies that he almost didn’t notice the girl laying on the couch covered in blood. One double take later and Beedel saw her, ran to her side and looked back to Ren, “Who is this?”
	Ren was crouched behind the doorway looking in. He took a good look at the woman laying on his couch and shrugged, “Is she dead?” 
	Beedel shrugged back. “I think it’s safe. It was probably her that broke in.” Beedel gestured to the trails of blood all around the room, “Looks like she was hurt beforehand.”
	Ren slowly entered and walked towards the couch. He looked around the room as he did. There was blood near the sink. All over the floor, and a whole lot of blood puddling on and near the couch. 
Ren noticed the girl’s beauty, her face was covered in blood, but behind all that she had excellent features. Ren began to daydream and wonder what kind of person she might be. Clearly she was a damsel in distress. Ren thought it would be nice to be the one to save her. It had been a long time since his last love.
Ren was getting excited which led to some confidence. He turned to Beedel with a sudden vigor, “We have to help her.”
Beedel, being initially suspicious of this wounded woman, simply replied, “No.”
Ren gave him a look, so Beedel continued, “Renny we don’t have time for this girl. Our hides will be forcibly stripped from our bodies and if we’re lucky we won’t be alive when they do it. So let’s get a move on.” Beedel looked down at her, he wanted to help too. He thought of the woman he’d chased in the alleys last night.
Then next words Ren spoke hit all the right nerves in Bedel’s psyche, “Beedel, it’s possible she was hurt during your standoff with the wizards earlier. This may very well be your responsibility.”
“You could be right.” Beedel was doubtful. Trying to think if this was the same woman.
“Right. So we’ll take her with us.” Ren eyes were adamant, “Where are we going anyway?”
“I told you, we’re getting out of the city.”
“The city is huge. If they are looking for us we won’t make it out and into the plains before the put up roadblocks.” Ren replied.
“You’re right, so we aren’t going that far.” Beedel smiled.
“Just tell me.” Ren moved closer towards the girl. 
“I’m going home Renny.” Beedel answered. “To the not-so-Great Wood.” Pinched between the city and the ocean it was home to many creatures and the ancestral home of the Arborians. Most of whom lived in the forest.
“Are you sure that’s safe?” Ren questioned.
“They are my family Ren.” Beedel replied. “And besides the treaty will keep the wizards from snooping around in the woods.”
“Right that’s out of our jurisdiction.” Ren was pleased. He’d not visited the Great Wood since he was a child. His attention quickly returned to the damsel. “So can your family help her as well?” 
Beedel spoke, “ Yes they can, but the wound looks severe. Can you close her wound at all?” 
Ren knew what Beedel meant. Many wizards could do basic healing magic. It was usually the go to spells that were first learned by wizards or anyone with the least magical aptitude. Ren replied with a stone in his throat, “Yes. Maybe a little.”
“Good.” Beedel was glad, moving the girl with a fresh wound would prove difficult. “What do you need from the shop? I can start gathering things together while you heal her.”
Ren agreed with a subtle nod and pulled out his crystal. “I’ll need my gun. The holster, a bullet vest, and all the bullets you can find.” He selected his spell and nearly activated it when he had another thought. “I should stay off the arcane network, right?”
“Definitely!” Beedel shouted from the other room. “They can use that to track us.” 
“Right, thought so.” Ren replied. He then manually disconnected his crystal from the network. “Alright, guess we’re doing this the old fashioned way.” Ren focused his own internal energy into the crystal to power the spell. A faint green light began glowing around the edges of Ren's fingers. With access to the grid’s energy he’d be able to do a lot more, Ren hoped this would be enough for now.
From the back room Beedel shouted back to Ren. “Sorry again about your doors!”
“Trying to focus over here!” Ren was close to reaching full charge for the spell. When it was almost there, but just slightly prior, Ren released the magical discharge into the damsel’s wound. She rebounded slightly from the impact of the energy and Ren feared his inexperience with healing would mean the worst outcome. But after another moment he was pleased to see that she hadn’t spontaneously combusted and was indeed still alive.
It looked as though the wound had closed up a bit. Maybe enough to transport her. Ren wasn’t quite sure. But he was quite sure that too many of those unrefined spells would cause more harm than good.
Beedel again called to him from the back room, “I found the gun, but do you really need all of these bullets?” Beedel was staring at the assortment on Ren’s desk. At least a few dozen bullets and not a single one was a duplicate. Each bullet had it’s own unique markings, colours, and style.
“Yes, I do.” Ren called back.  “You have your swords and that power armour. If you want me to be any use to you in a fight, I’ll need all of my bullets.” Ren walked over to the sink as he spoke. At the sink he found a cleanish cloth and wet it with warm water. He brought it to his patient’s face and wiped away most of the blood.
Beedel suddenly came back into the room with a look of playful panic, “Renny. There’s not enough room in the vest for all these bullets.”
Ren looked at him from his crouched position, bloody cloth in hand, “There’s a bag somewhere.”
“Gotcha!” And Beedel sped back into the other room.  Beedel quite enjoyed being needed. It was one of his favorite things to be. As Beedel rummaged around the room he was very careful to handle each bullet with care. Placing them gently into the vest and bag. Beedel didn’t know the full power that these magic bullets contained but he wasn’t ready to die in a blaze of hellfire because he made an assumption.
However it is important to note at this point that Beedel was not aware of the three Golden Bullets that Ren had stashed away in the workshop. Had Beedel known about those, he would have made sure to find all three and bring them with them. Such legendary power wouldn’t be easily overlooked. 
Ren, on the other hand, suspected the bullets to be nothing more than trinkets. He also had  a large portion of his attention devoted to the beautiful woman in tight leather clothing that needed his help. This combination led Ren to forget to mention the hidden compartment under his desk where he kept his valuables, among them two of his golden bullets. The final golden bullet was safely chambered inside Ren’s revolver since last night.
Beedel came back into the first room carrying all of Ren's equipment, weighing it on his power armour. Beedel spoke quickly, the urgency was growing within him, “Renny how we doin? Can she move?”
“Still unconscious” Ren replied. “But stable, I think.”
“Well pick her up, we gotta move.” Beedel began heading for the door, stopped turned to Ren and added, “No time to change your clothes.” 
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Ren found he had more important matters to concern himself with at the present moment. He lifted her firmly but gently over his shoulder. Ren wasn’t accustomed to such weight. But he felt that he could manage for a least a minute, maybe two. That’s when he spoke up, “You said you had a vehicle?”
“Yup. Custom made. She’s quite something.” Beedel’s voice was full of pride.
“Where is it? Wasn’t your house burned to the ground?” 
“Aye, it was Renny. But you wizards are far from the brightest bunch. No offense.”
Ren was offended, “None taken.”
“Our ride should be unscathed. Just follow me.” 
Beedel led Ren out of workshop and into the yard. They walked down the street and cut through a paved alley. Ren needed to stop for just a moment to catch his breathe. Even at walking pace the extra weight was taking it’s toll. Finally after a few more minutes and a couple more short breaks, they reached the back of Beedel’s place. 
To Ren’s eyes it was a miracle that the surrounding houses were undamaged. Considering the rubble that used to be Beedel’s home looked as though it had been the site of a meteor crash. Even the fences on either side of Beedel’s rubble were upright in pristine condition.
Ren was already exhausted by the short journey here. So he was a little more than frustrated that he had just carried an unconscious woman down the street, and now Beedel’s vehicle was nowhere in sight. Ren began speaking with a belittling tone, “I don’t see any…”
Beedel interrupted him with a quick shush. Then Ren realized Beedel was looking for something. Or rather he was counting something. Ren waited patiently for Beedel to finish. His arms quivered as the woman’s weight seemed to be growing with each passing moment. 
Suddenly Beedel jumped through some of the rubble near the back of where his house used to be. He found some rope and gave it a good tug. This opened an underground hatch. The hatch lifted up from beneath the rubble. It was quite large and made of a dark metal. It revealed the front of a vehicle just underneath the ground. 
Beedel came running back to Ren's side of the mechanism, “Out of the way Renny boy.” Ren realized he was standing directly in front of the hatch. Just as he side stepped away, some other set of mechanisms launched the vehicle forward just past where Ren had been standing.  
“What do ya think?” Beedel was showing off his pride and joy. That much was obvious. But the vehicle itself was like nothing Ren had ever seen.
Ren had read about when vehicles used to roll on wheels, but the technology was so inefficient energetically that it had long been replaced with modern hovercraft. This vehicle in particular had a sleek silver body that rolled like a wave. It had only a single glass window in the front, and the whole thing was surprisingly large.
Beedel noticed Ren's confusion. That was precisely the expected reaction and it set Beedel’s heart ablaze. “A classic beauty, wouldn’t you say?” Ren nodded, it was indeed beautiful in an old sort of way. Beedel continue his explanation, “It’s got a turbo boosted engine in the back and I’ve even converted the original to run off of water.” Beedel paused for effect. 
“You mean it doesn’t use arcane energy?” Ren asked.
“It’s powered by water Renny!” Beedel exclaimed, “They can’t track us if we aren’t using their precious energy.”
Ren thought about this for a moment and almost conceded to Beedel’s cleverness. “They won’t need to track our energy usage to find us in this thing?”
“Funny.” Beedel rolled his eyes. “You are right though, this will draw attention. But we need to go fast.”
“Then why not use the rail system? It’s quite fast you know.” Ren rebutted.
“I know how fast the rails can go Renny. But the rails can’t get us where we’re going.”
“Right. The woods.” Ren remembered.
“Plus we shouldn’t be using public transit with our guest in her condition.”
“Yeah, a private vehicle does make sense. But are you sure we won’t be caught?”
Beedel paused to look Ren in the eye for a moment. “It’s a big city. We have the landscape advantage.” 
Beedel pulled a handle on the side of the vehicle and opened the door. “Oh and I call her Greyworm.”
“”I’m sure she has a name Beedel. We don’t have to call her Greyworm.” Beedel gave Ren a look. Ren realized Beedel meant the vehicle. “Right. Let’s go.”
“There’s a seat in the back to strap her in.” Beedel gestured to their nameless party member. He helped Ren open the door and get her comfortable. Then they were on their way. Ren wasn’t accustomed to feeling the bumps and hops in the road. It was unnatural at first, but oddly comforting. Ren was never a great fan of flying.
As they drove through the city, they likely caught the attention of every citizen they passed. There would be very few among them who could say that this was their second sighting of a car with wheels. But to them it was nothing more than an interesting sight on an otherwise normal day in town. Most simply wrote it off, others ignored it completely. 
As the Greyworm roared through the city Ren and Beedel watched the expressions of the folk they passed on the street and they were both thinking the same thing. It was too damn difficult to impress anyone these days.

            <Title>Inside The Pit</Title>
            <Text>Grummin was alive. His eyes tried to adjust to the room, but the lack of light made the task quite challenging. There was a dim flickering far above him. After a moment Grummin remembered the fall and realized that the light must be the burning city. He had no idea how long it had been since he fell, but it mustn’t have been too long since the city was still a light.
	He wondered how he could survive such a drop. Then he questioned if he had. A quick check of all the major signs of life; pulse, breathe, thought, and the need to pee, told Grummin that he was indeed alive.
	Grummin’s focus shifted to how he was going to get out of this hole. He had at least a couple broken ribs and his ankle felt numb, likely broken too. Moving would be a struggle. The first thing Grummin noticed as he began to wiggle around was that it felt like he was laying on a very lumpy mattress. 
His eyes were slowly adjusting to the darkness but he still couldn’t make out any details of the terrain down here. He felt around a bit with his hands and when he felt fur beneath his fingers he nearly choked.
	He hadn’t noticed during his fight with Krozan but many of the roden chose to jump into the chasm. Hundreds of them plummeted to their deaths. Grummin guessed their little bodies couldn’t handle the impact especially considering his own broken condition. It was a miracle that he didn’t land on his head and Grummin guessed these bodies had softened his landing.
	What made his anguish swell up beyond his failure to protect the roden was the knowledge that he’d also failed to stop Krozan and massacres like these would continue to the other denizens of the tunnels. Grummin felt such shame. His father, Bezelnorf, had entrusted him with protecting the tunnels. 
Grummin could almost hear his father’s final words echoing through the caves. “Save the wardens.” And even though his father’s voice was only a pain induced mirage, it didn’t stop Grummin from yelling out, cursing his failure. 
His scream, echoed around the room, bouncing off the walls and back to Grummin surprisingly quickly. Gummin deduced that the room was a lot smaller than he originally assumed. It seemed the chasm tapered off quite quickly as it dropped down from the city.
	Grummin was startled by some nearby movement. A slow rustle of motion among the bodies. Grummin called out, “Who’s there?” In his state he would not be able to defend himself if some beast were to come around looking to feed.
	Grummin’s eyes had now adjusted enough to the darkness that he could make out a dark figure slowly emerging from a pile of roden corpses. This creature was big and as Grummin strained his eyes trying to get more detail the creature began to circle him. 
Every instinct in his body was telling him to run but his body screamed as he tried to get up. Grummin could do little more than prop himself up only to fall back flat a moment later. He was stuck there, watching as the beast approached one slow step at a time. Bones were crushed underneath its feet, and the bodies made terrible squishing noises as various organs were trampled without care.
	The beast was close now. Grummin still couldn’t make out what kind of creature was circling him. It was definitely something he’d never encountered. A six legged, large beast with some kind of mane, and it sounded as though it was walking with hooves. Grummin had also read about many creatures of the world in his bestiaries and yet he remembered nothing with this combination of features in any of the books.
What Grummin thought might be his final thought was that he wished he could at least see the creature that would claim his life. Suddenly as if Grummin’s wish had been heard and granted by the Gods. A light appeared. 
Simultaneously a steady blast of sound came flooding into the chasm. It was a drone in a low pitch like some sort of whistle. The beast reacted suddenly to the sound. Lifting it’s head in the general direction of the source of both the sound and the light.
Grummin caught a glimpse of the creatures face before it turned it’s head. It was feline, maybe a lion, he thought. Except instead of fur scales covered the creature’s face. Grummin continued to examine the beast in the new light. The creature’s whole body was covered in scales but there was patches of fur sporadically scattered around it’s body. The creature did indeed have six hooven legs and a long serpentine tail. But the most striking feature was the enormous pair of black feathered wings on the back of the creature.
Grummin thought it odd that such a creature would have wings when it inhabited the underground areas, but now he certainly know what he was dealing with; a chimera. A surprisingly large one at that. A chimera was essentially an unnatural mix of different creatures, fused together by old magically practices now seen as barbaric. The act of creating a chimera was strictly forbidden by most cultures. Therefore it was an example of magic that was classified by the association as black magic.
The beast hadn’t moved but only looked towards the approaching luminescence. Another whistle. Grummin couldn't lift his head enough to view the source of the light. However he could see more and more detail on the chimera and the it looked to be wincing at the sound. 
The room was getting much brighter. As it did, Grummin could see the dead faces of the roden that lay scorched and broken all around him. He began to regret wishing for the light.
The chimera remained close and sat itself down. It seemed to be waiting for whomever was holding the light to approach it. As if saying, I found something, come this way. 
“What a good pet. Have you found a live one?” The voice was old and horse. The source of the voice loomed over closer to Grummin and continued, “Oh my, we weren’t expecting such a big one to fall.” There was a deep growl in reply, it radiated from the inside of the beast.
“No no, my pet, we cannot eat this one. This one will be useful.” At this point the owner of the voice leaned over close enough to see Grummin’s face, and in turn Grummin could now see hers. She was an old roden, maybe as old as the chief.
Grummin struggled to speak, “Please, help me. I can’t move.” He instantly knew he was in trouble. It was something in the way she smiled when he told her he couldn’t move. This was Corina the roden witch. 
“How splendid.” She responded and then turned to speak to her pet, “Did you hear that puppet? He can’t move at all. Will you bring him home for me?” Her attention turned back to Grummin, “Don’t you worry, miss Corina will be taking very good care of you. Very good care, mister lizard.”  She grinned.
Grummin tried to ignore the slur but his body tensed. His mind commanded that his limbs move, but he could only manage to squirm. He was at the mercy of this witch. A witch who referred to herself in the third person. Just great, he thought to himself.
Corina grabbed something from one of her many pockets. It was a damp cloth. From another pocket she pulled out a vile of liquid. “Oh no, please stop fidgeting mister lizard.” She wet the cloth in the liquid, then reached over and placed the cloth over Grummin’s mouth. 
Grummin tried to resist, moving his neck back and forth, but even that caused him severe pain. “Stop it, please. No, don’t.” 
But it was too late she had covered his mouth and he was breathing in the fume. She spoke softly, “Do not fear, this will dull the pain.” Grummin was still conscious, but he could feel the substance taking effect and knew he wouldn’t be awake for much longer.
Corina began roping one of his ankles. The frayed rope burned as it twisted around, but Grummin began to feel it less and less. The chimera beast took another look and growled in disappointment. The growl sounded distant to Grummin, his senses began fading. He hardly noticed when the chimera began pulling the rope and dragging him along the ground.
As they passed by the last of the roden bodies and into a small tunnel, Grummin could swear he saw something familiar. It could have just been the drug kicking in, but it looked like Skeeter’s body. As Grummin was dragged even further down one of the pathways leaving the chasm, he stared at Skeeter’s body. 
Just as Grummin could feel the darkness coming to him he noticed a small spasm in the roden body. Then it rolled over. Grummin could see his face. His vision was fading but for a moment he thought he could see light in Skeeter's eyes. Grummin’s final thought was that if any of the roden could have survived that fall it would have been Skeeter. Skeeter was a fighter.

            <Title>Escape Plan</Title>
            <Text>Outside of a restaurant on the south side of the wizard tower things were picking up for the dinner rush. In the alley behind this restaurant there was a hidden doorway in the brickwall that would reveal itself to those who knew the proper code.
	Ren and Beedel were on the inside of the passageway. They were trying to exit the tunnels for at least fifteen minutes.
	“Are you sure you didn’t forget the code?” Ren asked.
	“No. No. I definitely have it this time. Just stop talking in my ear while I’m working.” Beedel replied. His plan to rescue Ren was suppose to be quick. Instead it had taken them much too long to find the exit and now Beedel’s frustration only rose as this roadblock persisted.
	Beedel tapped several bricks in sequence with his armoured hand. Then they waited for a moment in silence. 
After another moment Ren began, “Nothing’s happening.” He was leaning over Beedel’s shoulder watching him. 
	“Fuck it!” Beedel burst through the wall with his power armour. Bricks flew all around. Luckily there were no passing pedestrians in the line of brick fire. Most of the hidden mechanisms of the passageway were destroyed in the blast as well.
Ren felt it would be and good time for a humorous remark. But before he began he could see Beedel’s frustration. So he asked a question instead, “Why are you so frustrated Beedel? We’re out now. It’s okay.”
Beedel’s response came quickly, “We are not out yet Renny.” Beedel was in that dead serious attitude again. 
Ren didn’t question his reasoning. Beedel had been good to Ren thus far, so he went along with it, “Well, what now then?”
“We leave the city.” Beedel thought about it for a moment. Looked at Ren who was wearing some shabby work clothes. Then he continued, “We’ll go to your place, first. Then we leave the city.”
A few people were starting to peek into the alley after the commotion. Beedel took note of this and quickly covered up the big hole in the wall with a nearby dumpster. Beedel was easily able to push the half full metal dump bin where he needed it. Ren realized that this suit of armour gave Beedel a whole lot of strength, but it lacked capabilities when it came to small intricate movements, such as opening doors.
The hole was covered and the onlookers had dispersed. “Let’s go Renny.”
“I told you to stop calling me that.” Ren replied but his tone betrayed him. Ren had gotten used to the name from Beedel. Of course he wouldn’t let Beedel know that.
“Sure thing, Renny.” Beedel smiled as they both ran off, down through the alleys.

            <Title>Battle In The Undercity</Title>
            <Text>Grummin crawled as quickly as he could out of the chief’s den. As he pushed the curtain out of the way he saw several of the rats who previously escorted him scurrying away with their weapons drawn. The echo of the scream was still ringing in the lower levels of the hole.  
Grummin was relieved to see that his power armour hadn’t been completely dismantled. It only took him a moment to return his gauntlets to their proper home. As he did this Grummin’s keen senses picked up the slightest of movements from behind him. He quickly charged some energy into his gauntlets as he spun around. Grummin’s fist swung around with him ready to release charged blast of energy.
For a moment Grummin hoped that somehow a feral creature had found a way into the city and was hunting an unlucky roden. Unfortunately Grummin’s hope was shattered when saw the figure. It was one of his warden brothers leaping at him from a nearby rooftop. 
Grummin couldn’t see the assassin’s face as he was wearing a daemon mask. A tool Grummin had heard about but hoped would never be used again by the wardens. It enhances the user's vision in the dark, allowing them to act in the shadows.
The attacker was airborne brandishing two small blades. Grummin’s fist was lined up perfectly to connect with the assassin’s core. The force of the punch alone was enough to knock the any draconian to the ground, but Grummin was furious. His anger fueled his strength and he released a large blast at the moment of impact with the flying assassin. The explosion filled the hole with fantastic red lights and a deafening burst of sound. 
The attacker was sent flying back the way they had come and landed firmly into the wall behind Aizen’s chamber. The draconian body covered in dark red robes was now unconscious. Through the doorway Grummin could see several curious faces poking through. Grummin yelled out to them, “Stay inside!”
He received a few  nods, as they scurried back into their home. The only one who remained was Skeeter. Skeeter took a few confident steps forward. Grummin would have repeated himself but he could see Skeeter’s determination.
Grummin was still on edge. There would be likely more assassins around. He needed to get their attention and stop this before any more violence occurred. 
So Grummin called out into the darkness, “My warden brothers, it is I, Grummin Irontooth.” Grummin’s voice boomed and echoed through the now silent rat hole. 
No immediate response so Grummin continued, “I have made parley with the chief of the roden. A dialogue has been opened. The recent attacks have not been from the roden. I can confirm that now. A foul witch is responsible for the chimera beasts. Please stop your assault, both of our people want peace.” Just as he was finishing those last few words a heavily armoured draconian emerged from the shadows. 
It was Krozan. Grummin could see the shock in Krozan’s face. Grummin was suppose to be escorting a wizard. Krozan’s look of shock slowly faded into a look of calculation, then finally it morphed into a devious look that made Grummin uneasy. 
Several other draconian assassins revealed themselves in the darkness around the city. They were scattered around to completely surround the roden city. There was an eerie quiet while roden warriors gathered around accessing the situation. Most of the assassins were already covered in blood. Grummin suspected it was the blood of the city guards.
Krozan looked long and hard at Grummin. He was standing several platforms above Grummin. After several moments of silence. Krozan finally spoke, “Who let the rat squeal?”
Suddenly one of the assassins from a few platforms up jumped down to Krozan’s side. He saluted his leader before speaking, “I did, Sir. My blade missed her throat by a hair and...” The sentence was cut short. The assassin’s head was swiftly removed from his body.
Krozan’s movements were deceptively fast in his hulking armour. Armour that used to be a symbol of fatherhood and pride to Grummin, it was only a symbol of corruption now.
Krozan hadn’t used any arcane energy to end the life of his comrade. Krozan’s strength had been enough. Grummin hadn’t even flinched, he had come to expect such brutality from his uncle. Some of the roden made sounds of terror at such an act. 
One young roden, who will remain nameless, tried to make a run for the exit. All the exits were at the top tier of the city, the same level Grummin had entered from. The roden had scurried so quickly it had been hard to trace. His heavy breathing and scurrying were the only sounds in the whole city. Everyone seemed to be listening, and hoping that he would make it. If he could escape it would give the roden a good deal of hope. 
When he finally got close to the top, a warden stepped up toward the large in front of him. The roden’s eyes saw only the fury in the warden’s mask. Then the only sound was that of the hammer crushing through flesh and bone. With that their hope had also been crushed.
Several more wardens walked forward to the edge of the top level. Grummin, along with every roden who dared look up, could see that there was enough of them to complete a ring around the city, blocking them all from escaping. The true panic had begun.
Skeeter was the only other person Grummin could see who was still ready to put up a fight. As the shrieks of the roden people continued to echo through the caves, Grummin quietly spoke to Skeeter, “Is there any other way out of this hole?” Grummin wasn’t sure Skeeter heard him through the panic.
Grummin kept his eyes on Krozan who was smiling back at Grummin while cleaning some of the flesh out of his gauntlets.
‘Afraid not.’ Skeeter answered. “Unless you want to brave the chasm.” Grummin nodded. He didn’t plan on finding out how deep this hole would go. 
Skeeter continued, “You’re not trying to go back on your promise, are you?”
“Just hoping it might still be possible to evacuate your people.” Grummin took a breath. “So we fight then.” 
Skeeter’s response was simple, but profoundly impactful to Grummin, “Aye.”
Krozan was now bored of cleaning his gear and decided to address his disobedient nephew, “So you’ve abandoned your assignment to come here and die among the vermin?” 
Grummin dare not answer, nothing he could say would change his uncle’s mind. He also knew that Krozan wanted to get rid of him. Always sending him on menial tasks and grunt work. Krozan was trying to keep Grummin out of the spotlight. All of this was in hopes to reduce the amount of political power Grummin could attain within the wardens. 
Krozan wasn’t exactly evil. He simply believed all other species were inferior to the draconians. He only worked with the humans because the wizards were too powerful to overthrow. That of course was one of his long term plans. For now his attention was focused on the roden. He disregarded all of their unique culture and thought them to be nothing more than disgusting scavengers, little more than rats. 
Krozan was now getting impatient. He lifted his left arm high in the air. It was a signal to the wardens up top and they responded swiftly. Some produced torches others produced canisters of oil. At the sight of the black liquid and the fire the panicked roden all froze.
Krozan kept his hand lifted as he spoke. “I’ll give you one last chance nephew. Leave these rats to us and leave the ranks of the wardens. Then I will let you live.” 
Grummin would have admitted that it was tempting offer. Grummin responded loudly making sure his comrades could hear him, “You are making a mistake uncle! These people have nothing to do with the chimera attacks. This will be a slaughter of the innocent.”
	There was no response from Krozan. Then he dropped his hand. The wardens around the top of the hole began raining oil down onto the roden homes. Many of the roden began leaving the safety of their homes and trying to make a wild run for the exits. The several assassins who were still within the hole killed as many as they could. It wasn’t difficult and the bodies began piling up around them. Most put up no fight, focusing solely on escape.
Few roden did manage to slip by the wardens in the hole, but they were swiftly booted back down by the wardens awaiting them at the top. None were able to escape.
	One roden fell right past where Grummin stood, and down into the chasm. The hole itself was very large and the oil remained mostly on the inside walls, but those walls were already covered and once the fires were lit it would spread throughout city. Grummin noticed all of the flammable goods and shuddered. 
The wardens up top still held the torches at the ready. Waiting for Krozan’s final signal.
	Grummin called out to his uncle, “Stop this madness! Fight me now and let the fate of these people be determined by your metal!” Grummin knew that challenging Krozan would buy them some time. He wouldn’t be able to back down without losing a good deal of respect from his supporters. Grummin was almost as strong as Krozan. It was possible he could win the fight.


That may have been the case but then Aizen, He Who Leads The Roden, had come out in an attempt to end the fighting. Aizen slowly walked out of his chamber, against the wishes of many of the roden inside who were still calling him back into the safety of the building. Grummin didn’t know how safe it would remain when the fire starter.
Aizen strode up slowly to Grummin’s side, wincing occasionally at the pain in his hip. He had a small wooden walking cane, which he needed desperately in order to maintain his balance. Skeeter met him halfway and helped him with the rest of the walk. For a moment the cries of the roden faded. They adored their chief. No one would want to miss a chance to hear his wisdom, especially if it may be the last time they get to hear him.
	Aizen took a deep breath. And then he took another. And then a few more. Grummin was shocked that Krozan was actually being this patient, but he could see it wouldn’t last. Aizen was now ready, he began to speak, it was louder than any words he had spoken in years, but he wanted and needed to be heard now more than ever before, “My people…” That’s when Krozan shot him in the head.
	It wasn’t Krozan specifically who pulled the trigger but rather one of his loyal assassins. Krozan however did make the call and his hand was still pointing towards Aizen. 
As the old roden fell to the ground Skeeter screamed, as did many others in the hole. Skeeter caught his chief and mentor in his arms. There were no other words from the roden chief, he was already gone.
Skeeter’s pain morphed into rage and it was all directed at a single target. Skeeter rushed forward completely blind to any danger. Grummin tried to stop him but Skeeter moved too quickly. He climbed up and around the walkways in the city, moving faster than he ever has. Skeeter positioned himself slightly above Krozan and sprang into the air with his spear drawn. 
Krozan had the advantage of a clear mind. Skeeter was too mad to think clearly and simply pounced towards his target with all his might. But it wasn’t enough. As Skeeter cleared the distance between them Krozan yelled out to his comrades, “Burn it to the ground!” Skeeter barely noticed. He was too focused on his assault to become any more enraged.
Krozan’s defense came swiftly. A backhand swing, similar to the attack on his now beheaded comrade, collided with Skeeter and sent him flying with a good deal of force. Unfortunately for Skeeter the direction was downward, into the chasm.
Grummin watched as Skeeter fell simultaneously the first torches landed into pools of oil and ignited them. The initial blasts spread the fire around quickly. Grummin had failed, but his challenge hadn’t. 
Krozan leaped down onto the same catwalk where Grummin stood. They were on opposite ends of the catwalk, the distance would be trivial to them both once the fighting began.
Meanwhile the assassins in the hole were leaping out to the safety of the top level. Nearly all the roden were running around trying to find escape the hellish fires. Some tried to reach the top level by climbing the walls. There were still paths which hadn’t been splashed with oil but it funneled them, making them easy targets for the wardens. The wardens blasted the panicking roden with volleys of bullets. Those lucky enough to be spared by the bullets, were either sliced, smashed or kicked off back into the hole.
Other roden tried frantically to dig holes into the walls. They looked for secret passages that their minds demanded existed. Many fell into the flames, the smell of burning flesh and fur began to fill the air. Some roden even willingly jumped down into the chasm. 
Grummin could see the joy in his uncle’s face. This was true chaos and Krozan loved every moment of it. Grummin could not wait any longer. He charged all the energy he could muster into his gauntlets. 
Earlier he didn’t have the time to don his chest plate. He was practically naked compared to Krozan’s full plate armour. Krozan lowered his demon mask over his face and also began charging his gear.
With a lack of armour Grummin couldn’t risk being on the defensive. He jumped forward running at near full speed. Krozan took a defensive stance, ready to retaliate. Just prior to entering attack range Grummin punched the ground at his feet releasing a burst of energy and launching himself upward. Krozan was caught off guard for only a moment and quickly found his target. 
Krozan was about to jump up to collide with Grummin in mid air, but when he began flexing for the jump, the ground beneath his feet collapsed. It took Krozan several moments regain his footing and avoid failing. Those moments were the opening Grummin had hoped for. As he fell, Grummin prepared a powerful punch.
Krozan barely had time to interpret Grummin’s incoming attack. Krozan swung and nearly hit Grummin’s ribs. Whereas Grummin’s punch landed square in Krozan’s face. Grummin’s punch was amplified by the power coursing through his gauntlets and fortunately it was enough power to break through Krozan’s defense. At the last moment Krozan released some energy from his own armour to send a shockwave. This knocked Grummin back away as Krozan was slammed down into the ground by the force of Grummin’s punch. 
Grummin had been blasted through the solid stone wall of a roden dwelling at the end of the catwalk.  He was was in a small room but the ceiling was surprisingly high. Grummin was able to stand fully upright, although he was very sore.
	He had just a moment to catch his breath before Krozan came blasting through the rest of the wall. Part of the roof collapsed and debris came flying into the room. Krozan’s mask had shattered inward, it made an awful mess of his face and blood dripped down covering the front of his armour. There were small pieces of metal shrapnel lodged into his face. His left eye was covered in blood and looked severely wounded, but in Krozan’s right eye Grummin saw rage. 
The holes in the roof provided pathways for the flaming oil to pour through. This provided a temporary shield for Grummin, as there was no path that Krozan could pass through without getting caught by the oil.
	From Grummin’s perspective, this was some kind of living hell. Liquid fire pouring down from the sky, a city in flames, terrified cries of innocent people, and the enraged figure of his murderous uncle standing before him. 
Krozan yelled, “My face. You’ll burn for this traitor.”
Grummin used this opportunity to poke a little fun at his uncle’s new visage, “I think it’s an improvement.” Grummin tried to smile in spite, but it was difficult through his fear. 
His uncle let out a primal scream. For a moment Grummin thought his uncle might just be dumb enough to try to cross the wall of liquid fire. But Grummin was not so lucky. Krozan simply waited patiently for his prey.
He wouldn’t have to wait for much longer. The flow of burning oils was slowing. Grummin took a moment and closed his eyes. He breathed in deeply. A few breaths later, he was calm. The fear remained, but it was now a tool he could used to motivate his body. He was in control, a sharp contrast to Krozan in this moment.
Krozan jumped forward as soon as he saw an opening in the falling oil. But Grummin had the jump on him. Grummin flipped a burning wooden table up towards his uncle. Krozan halted to shield himself from the flaming projectile. But before the table hit Krozan, Grummin hit the table. 
Krozan tried to shield his last good eye from the wooden shrapnel. However it was Grummin’s fists that dealt a series of powerful blows. 
Every time Grummin’s fist made contact he released a small burst of energy. Grummin was very strong on his own, he didn’t need to use a ton of magic to do some real damage. Each hit knocked Krozan back another step. Grummin definitely had the advantage but Krozan was keeping up with him, rolling with hit after hit using his armour to absorb most of the blows. But Grummin didn’t let up. Punch after punch after punch. They were now out in the middle of a large catwalk. Grummin went for a large final attack, focusing all of his energy into his fist.
A direct hit right into Krozan’s gut. His plate armour broke open, it couldn’t handle any more damage and Krozan fell to his knees. Grummin felt some pain when the armour cracked but he knew it was no longer his father’s. Krozan began to cough up blood at Grummin’s feet. Grummin had won and was about to take the final blow to Krozan’s life, but he saw an opportunity to ask a question. 
“Why do this? Why go against my father’s ideals?” The city around them was quietly burning, all signs of roden life had been ended. The only movement now was the dancing of the flames around them. 
Krozan looked up at Grummin, as he wiped some of the blood from his mouth. “Your father was a fool. These creatures are but pests.”
	“You’re wrong.” Grummin knew there would be no reasoning.
As Grummin began pulling back for his attack Krozan spoke four small words that stunned Grummin, “I killed your father.” 
The hesitation was enough time for Krozan to lift his arm and release a huge blast of energy towards Grummin. The blast knocked Grummin back along the catwalk. Krozan had released nearly all his energy in one single blast. It was intensely powerful. Grummin hit the ground rolled right off the edge of the catwalk and barely caught the ledge.
As Grummin held on with a single hand he looked around and saw that there were no other catwalks below him. The only thing below him was darkness. Even with all the new light from the fires the drop still appeared bottomless. He thought about swinging over to the nearest wall, but it was covered in flames. 
Krozan was standing above him on the catwalk. His one eye was nearly shut and covered in blood. He slowly placed a heavy boot on top of Grummin’s hand. He twisted his boot ever so slightly onto Grummin’s fingers. Grummin had so many questions, that he barely felt the pain.
Krozan began speaking, in a tone that was victorious and showed he was very pleased with himself, “You might be thinking that there’s no way it could be true. Your father died of natural causes, of course. Just another one of your uncle’s dirty tricks.” 
Grummin was losing grip. His fingers were being crushed. Krozan’s foot was the only thing holding him up at this point and Krozan knew it.
Krozan pushed just a little bit harder onto Grummin’s hand as he spoke, “I did kill your father. I poisoned him, slowly over the years, to make it look natural.” 
Grummin’s mind was not ready for this. He began to thrash about, Krozan was caught off guard and laughingly said, “Watch out Grum, we wouldn’t want you falling just yet, I have so much more to tell you.” 
Grummin wasn’t listening, he was simply trying to break free from this man, he would hear no more of his vile words. Krozan spoke on, “Don’t you want to know what happened to your mother?”
Grummin made a final thrash. It was enough to slip his hand out from beneath Krozan’s foot. As Grummin fell backwards into the chasm he lifted a hand and made a gesture, which in draconian culture meant, see you in hell.
This angered Krozan immensely.

            <Title>Surges Of Pain</Title>
            <Text>Back in Ren's workshop Umbra’s consciousness slowly returned to her body. The afternoon light burst through the windows and directly into the slits in her eyes. Her pain had subsided to a low rumble in her left side. She lifted her hand to block the light from her eyes. The brightness rattled around in her mind, given her a throbbing headache. Her other hand reached down to feel her wound.
	The blood in her clothes was dry, but the wound was still fresh. A metallic scent filled her nostrils. It reminded Umbra of the previous night. Suddenly two fears sprung through her body. Umbra reached for her throat and discovered that her newly acquired accessory was still around her neck. The jerk had reignited the pain, but she was glad it hadn’t all been for nothing.
	Umbra’s second fear was that she had slept much too long in this workshop and the owner might return any moment. She tried to move but she could barely sit up on her own. That’s when the idea hit her. An idea that can easily be argued that it came from a place of reason, but in fact it gave from a much darker place in Umbra’s mind.
The Dust that Jak had given her was strong stuff. Jak had warned that it was a potent substance, ready to take over any weak willed individual courageous enough to partake. But Jak believed Umbra was strong of will. He wasn’t wrong, these things are just a matter of degree. Desperation to return to Jak was driving Umbra’s willpower way down. 
As the fear began to take over Umbra’s mind the thought that the Dust provided a potential solution became stronger. Umbra didn’t bother thinking out the details and assumed that the enhanced senses could provide the extra boost she needed to start moving again.
The last straw was when Umbra felt an urge for the high the Dust provided. She felt pretty damn low right now and anything that might help would be welcome. She fiddled slowly through her pockets, each movement causing her to wince at her pain. After a few more seconds she found the small pouch of Dust, she was thankful it didn’t take longer.
There was little hesitation. She took a large pinch of Dust and dropped it into her mouth. It was a messy process. The falling had kicked up in her mouth and caused a good deal of coughing. 
This made her wound ache even louder, but then she began to feel the Dust kicking in. Fast acting as guaranteed. Umbra’s mind calmed for moment with the relief. 
Just as she began to relax the pain had returned violently. It sparked into overdrive, very quickly becoming worse than before. She wasn’t expecting her heightened senses caused her sensation of the pain to worsen. The dull moan of pain had suddenly ignited into a raging fire of sharp needles. It felt as though someone thrice her size was jumping rope on top of her body.
The pain began spreading. She could feel every small bruise and tiny scratch screaming out in agony. Her major wound seemed to be rejecting the very idea of existence. Luckily the pain was so intense that Umbra fainted from the extreme stimuli. But not before writhing in the sensations for what felt to her as several hours. It was actually about a minute of pain, but the mind has a funny way of altering the perception of time, usually opposed to the perceivers desires. 
Before she finally passed out, Umbra had managed to vomit a good deal of blood all over the couch she laid on. Ren would have a hell of a time cleaning out the stains.

            <Title>Save The Pit</Title>
            <Text>Grummin knew these tunnels well, better than most. From the scratches on the brickwork to the smells on the air. It only took him several minutes to reach his destination. Grummin believed that the wardens had planned to send a small stealth team to exterminate the roden. And he hoped he wasn’t too late to prevent it.
Grummin also believed that diplomacy could bring about true peace. They already had a treaty and talks were going well up until the chimeras showed up. Grummin needed to convince the chief of the roden to cease his assault and get his uncle to do the same. He didn’t know which would be more difficult.
This entrance to the roden undercity was what you could call the main entrance. It had been carved away out of the rock and looked more like a cave mouth. There were many entrances to the roden undercity but this was one of the few that a full grown draconian could walk through, albeit crouching a little bit. 
The gate itself was a makeshift doorway, crafted from all sorts of old lumber, driftwood, metal pipes, plastic flaps and many other materials. At first glance you might mistake this gate for a pile of debris. But to the experienced eye you could see that there were several openings in the gate. These opening were about the the size of the average full grown roden, which was about a quarter the size of a draconian. 
Although you shouldn’t let their size fool you. The roden were cunning and fast. When they out numbered you, it was a dangerous spot to be in, even for a draconian warden. But nonetheless Grummin marched up to the front gate and knocked.
Judging by the relative silence, Grummin assumed Petra’s distraction had worked and he’d made here it before Krozan. He could barely hear the little voices whispering on the inside of the gate. The roden guards stationed at the gate were especially suspicious and usually didn’t show themselves unless necessary. Perhaps that hoped he’d just go away. A draconian showing up alone at their front door was odd enough. That same draconian knocking instead of smashing through the door was absurd. They needed to discuss it before reacting.
Finally after a few moments, a roden pushed his head through one of the latches to get a look at Grummin. They made eye contact for just a moment, then suddenly he pulled his head back in and Grummin could faintly hear the next round of whispering. He thought it a good time to speak up, “I come with intentions of peace and of a warning to all your people!”
The whispering stopped as he spoke. A rat spoke from the other side, without showing his face, “ There is no peace with you brutes! Leave now or else we will be forced to attack.”
Grummin knew this would be difficult but he needed to speak to their leader. “I mean no harm. I seek an audience with the chief.” There was no response. He needed to hurry, the stealth team would be coming soon. “Your families are in great danger. You need to evacuate immediately.” 
Still no response, but he could hear them whispering. Deciding whether or not to release their chimera beasts on him. In fact Grummin was quite surprised that they hadn’t already sent out some chimeras. 
He needed to prove himself to them. Roden, like draconians, valued actions over words. So Grummin took a deep breathe. “Please, I’m trying to save you, my father Bezelnorf wanted to live peacefully with all the creatures under the city.” As he spoke Grummin began to remove his bracers. Then the rest of his armour. This action would be understood universally by any creature capable of using weapons. Grummin was prepared to offer his life to speak with their chief. Throwing all of his goods to the ground, feeling quite naked without his armour, he got on his knees and pleaded one final time. “Please! There isn’t much time.”
There was another pause, no immediate response. But there was no whispering either. Grummin kept his head bowed and low to the ground. He was just about ready to give up when he heard a heavy bolt slide back behind the gate. Then the whole gate slowly swung open. Grummin wasn’t entirely sure that large makeshift door could open. It was possible that only the small latches would open and that he’d have to squeeze through. But Grummin was pleased when he saw that it did indeed open to accommodate someone of his size.
A roden with orange fur, small even for their standards, stuck his head out of the door. He held a small spear made from a broken dagger and a metal pipe. He kept the spear at his side ready for a potential trap. He spoke, and Grummin could hear the fear in his throat, “Look me in the eye, draconian.”
This request was common among many cultures. It was believed that one would have a very difficult time lying, during intentional eye contact. Asking someone to repeat themselves while looking you in the eye was seen as a way to begin an open dialogue. To establish trust. 
There was no direct proof that the eye contact principle worked, and in fact there were many who’ve mastered lying techniques that could easily overcome the eye contact test. But this made it more of a social contract, like a promise. Lying after being asked to look into someone's eyes was considered powerfully disrespectful. Some cultures would even kill for such a betrayal. The roden were one of those cultures.
Grummin lifted his head slowly and made eye contact as requested. Grummin’s gaze was fiercely serious and it was almost too much for the roden, but he maintained his eye contact as well. 
Grummin spoke with clarity and desperation, “You are all in grave danger.” They’re eyes remained in contact for some time. 
The roden nodded and acknowledged Grummin’s determination. He turned his head back and signalled his allies. Several more emerged from behind the gate, all of which had some sort of makeshift weapon similar to the first roden’s spear.
The first roden spoke again to Grummin, “No quick moves, come with us.” Several roden surrounded him with their weapons drawn. A few others grabbed his gear and carried it in. It took more than one just to lift each piece of armour. 
Grummin slowly got to his feet and followed them through the gate.
The roden city was much larger than Grummin had imagined. He thought that the stealth team might actually have their hands full trying to trap and exterminate the entire city. The city itself was a huge cavity in the earth. The centre of which was simply a giant hole dug out of the ground. Surrounding the hole was a large circular plateau. Many structures aligned the walls on the plateau, most of which appeared to be some kind of barracks or soldier outpost. There were also several tunnels around the circumference of the city similar to the one he had arrived through, Grummin assumed it was the other exits. He feared that any moment a group of his warden brothers might crash though and begin the extermination. He prayed there was enough time.
They approached the massive hole. There were several paths leading down and around the hole. Cross beams, like catwalks, were scattered through the hole. Looking down Grummin could see them jutting out throughout the hole. Outward from structures, outward from walls. The roden were busy scurrying across with jugs, packs, and tools. Most of these roden were stunned to see him there, although they didn’t appear to be afraid. Likely because he was surrounded by quite a dozen guards, that would keep the roden calm. But it didn’t stop them from staring, and most went clear out of their way to avoid crossing paths with him.
This hole had been dug out by the roden over many generations. Grummin was almost in awe at the structures. The buildings were mostly carved out of the rocks. Many were still half covered by natural stone. 
The dozen roden that surrounded him were all keeping a strict eye on him as they marched downward and deeper into the hole. They occasionally gave him a small warning. Either verbally or using the sharp ends of their weapons against his backside. This didn’t help Grummin’s balance. The walk ways weren’t meant for someone of his size. He had to be extra cautious with his footing. A slip up here would mean he’d go fumbling down into the depths of the hole. That wasn’t an appealing event for many reasons. Not the least of which was that Grummin still hadn’t received any visual confirmation that the hole had a bottom.
There was a good deal of fire light in the upper areas of the city. However down in the lower area, light seemed to be getting scarce. Except for a few glowing windows, the paths he was being led down was mostly dark. That wouldn’t bother the roden for their vision in the dark was nearly as good as a human’s vision on a bright day. This was partially due to their acute sense of smell. Draconians fell somewhere in between, working best in low light, but in the complete dark Grummin would be just as lost as a human.
Grummin was getting nervous. Not much was known about the roden culture. It did however seem odd that their chief would be living in the lower parts of the city. This was completely counter intuitive compared to most leaders that grummin had read about. They usually preferred to be seated high above everyone else in a show of superiority. 
Grummin wondered how much farther the down this hole he’d have to travel before he could see the chief. In his urgency, Grummin began to fear that he wasn’t being led to the chief at all. Grummin tried to remove the thought from his mind, he’d shared a promise with the orange roden that led them now.
Grummin decided to ask if they were close, but just before he asked the orange roden spoke.
“Here we are. Our leader is inside, greet him with respect or else you’ll never leave this hole lizard.”
The slur had hurt Grummin, draconians were proud of their ancestry. Being simplified to a animal was very insulting and he felt compassion for the roden who were often mocked as being no more than mere rats. 
When his attention returned to their destination Grummin was shocked. The building that stood before him was no different than the rest, in fact it looked a little run down compared to its nearest neighbours. This didn’t do a lot for Grummin’s confidence. Last change for him to make a run for it. But he couldn’t bring himself to do that now. He told himself that his father wouldn’t have run, and neither will he, no matter the consequences.
Grummin was ushered in by the same roden who had vouched for him at the gate. He hadn’t learned this roden’s name, however Grummin thought him to be a clever one, perhaps a leader in his community. 
A curtain that was being used as a door was lifted away. Thankfully this doorway was huge by roden standards so Grummin needed only to bend down a bit to get through. The orange-haired roden followed him into the building while the rest of them remained outside with his armour.
The roden weren’t foolish enough to bring the draconian’s weapons into their leader’s chambers with him. Besides the roden are curious creatures. Tinkerers by nature, they love to mess around with newer technology whenever they got a chance. 
The inside of the chief’s chambers were rather large. It was much bigger than it appeared on the outside. This particular building had been laid into the wall. But the inside had been carved out to create a huge chamber. This made a bit more sense to Grummin, the outside was  sort of an illusion. Invaders would have a hard time locating the chief’s home among the thousands of others. 
Grummin thought this was quite clever, in fact he half remembered an old proverb that went something like; a leader who sits upon a throne, is quite the easy target.
Inside the chief’s chamber, there was easily a few dozen roden inside. Many of which were sitting up on higher tiers along the walls. The room was build like a large atrium, there were several cascading levels along every wall except the one with the door way he’d come through. The walls weren’t exactly straight or even but Grummin could tell the roden had put a lot of extra work into making them particularly smooth. 
Some were drinking, others looked to be playing some kind of dice game. All of them looked to be having a good time until Grummin walked in. A silence fell upon the room. It was so sudden it was startling. All the roden were in such synchronicity, they all turned their heads towards him in unison.
On the far side of the room opposite to Grummin, there was a throne of sorts. It wasn’t a fancy sort of chair, like one that you could see in old paintings of human Kings long past. The biggest difference was that it looked comfortable. The roden sitting on it had to be the oldest that Grummin had ever laid eyes on. The fur on his scalp was thin and his beard was almost completely white, and it was quite long. His fur was a soft grey, not from age, but simply in colour. He wore a large pair of glasses, likely something found in the trash. The glasses looked much too big for his face and was likely a pair made for a human. But somehow it suited him. It made him appear wise. 
Most draconians didn’t live to be very old. Many died in the line of battle, well before time could steal away their youth. With the exception of Grummin’s father, Bezelnorf, Grummin had very little experience with the elderly. But he did notice a few things about the roden chief. 
First of all, he sat in a way that showed he was uncomfortable. Or rather that this awkward position was the most comfortable position he had. Sort of a best of the worst kind of posture. Bezelnorf was the same in the months before he passed. Once he found that position it was very unlikely that he’d move out of it for some time. 
The orange roden that led Grummin made the introduction, “Welcome draconian. This is our chief, He Who Leads The Roden, Lord Aizen.”
The roden chief was facing to the side, he had been speaking to another, likely an advisor of sorts. So when he turned only his neck to face Grummin, instead of his whole body, Grummin could see the pain although he hid it well. This also explained his throne. It was covered in pillows and other soft materials. 
The roden chief examined Grummin for a while, then slowly thought of how he wished to greet this unexpected guest. He smiled, a pleasing sight to Grummin, then spoke softly barely more than a whisper, but in this profound silence it rang loud, “Welcome Grummin Irontooth, son of Bezelnorf the Great Pacifist.” 
Grummin was stunned. He had mentally prepared a respectful greeting but all that had been lost. The only thing that came out of his mouth was breath as he silently opened and closed his mouth.
The chief smiled a mischievous smile, he had wanted to shock him. He revelled in his success for a few moments and then continued, “We have been expecting you, Grummin. You’re father foretold that you’d one day come to us.”
Grummin was finally able to say something, “You knew my father?” Grummin was still crouched. If he stood straight up he’d likely hit his head, although the ceilings were tall enough that he could stand if he remained bent slightly.
The orange haired roden was angered by Grummin’s lack of respect. He stepped forward and grabbed Grummin’s shoulder. The grip was much stronger than Grummin would have expected. 
He spoke standing up straight so they were nearly face to face, “Show some respect.” As the roden spoke many of his kin sitting around the room mumbled in agreement. The low murmur continued for a few moments until Grummin regained his composure. They were right, he needed to focus and present himself as the emissary he was trying to portray. He had gotten this far, now was not the time to be asking questions.
Grummin bowed as the chief spoke, it was a bit louder than before, “Skeeter, He Who Dances With Trash, there is no need to be foul to our guest.” Upon hearing the first syllable the room fell silent once more. They hung off of every one of Aizen’s words. Grummin made note of roden’s name, wondering how they had decided upon that name. The he recalled that Beedel had spoken a similar name to someone before their encounter earlier. 
Skeeter let go of Grummin and backed off. He lowered his head towards his King and said, “I’m sorry my lord.” He then stepped back into the crowd, but Grummin could feel Skeeter’s eyes constantly watching him. Skeeter wasn't convinced that this draconian should be trusted simply because he was the son of the Great Bezelnorf.
Aizen, the chief, began to speak once more, “Grummin, please take a seat.” Grummin looked around at the few tiny chairs in the room. He felt confused, did he really expect him to fit into one of those chairs. But suddenly there was a tapping on his back. Grummin looked behind him. There was a young roden behind him. She was rather cute and very shy. She presented a large cushion on the ground behind Grummin. Grummin thanked her and she scuttled off without saying a word.
Grummin sat down, he had a moment to calm his mind and organize his thoughts. Aizen gave him the time he needed then he continued, “Grummin, you have come bearing a great warning have you not?”
Grummin responded with urgency, “Yes your Majesty.” Grummin wasn’t sure how to formally address the chief just yet.
Aizen responded, “Call me Aizen. You are an honoured guest. Your father foretold of a grave danger and that you’d be the one to come to our aid.”
“Yes... Uh Aizen.” Grummin wanted to ask so many questions about this father. But now was not the time, “There is currently an elite assassination team on their way to your city.” This claim caused a commotion in the audience. They began to speak amongst themselves. 
But once again when Aizen began to speak they all immediately quieted themselves. “We feared this day. What can we do?”
Grummin was a little taken aback by the King’s question, surprised that his opinion was in demand, it was an unusual event, “We need to evacuate the city. I can try to convince the wardens to stop their attacks. But you’ll also need to call off your chimeras.” At the mention the chimeras another round of discussion sparked in the audience.
Aizen responded curiously, “We have control over no such creatures. It is not in our nature to use such magic nor do we condone the warping of nature into those abominations.” 
This didn’t make any sense to Grummin, “Then where did the beasts come from, they attacked us from this direction.”
“The witch, Corina.” The king spoke with a fierce sureness. “She is the only one among us who would tinker with such things.”
“Then can’t you order her to stop.” Grummin wasn’t sure about how the power system worked in the roden culture.
“My people do not respond to orders, we live by a code of respect. Corina has never shown me any respect. And as such she does not choose to live among us in the city.” The chief spoke not out of hatred or fear, but out of sadness. “Corina wanted to send enough of these creatures to annihilate all of the draconian wardens. I refused, she was furious and tried to attack me. Claiming that I was a weak.” Aizen chuckled and continued, “She was right. I am weak, I cannot protect me people any longer. I’m too old to fight.” 
Skeeter jumped in from the sideline, “You are  strong my lord. You have led our people to a prosperous time.” 
The King smiled at Skeeter. It was a smile that said thank you for your kindness, even though you are mistaken. He responded to Skeeter, but he spoke towards Grummin, “During my rule countless roden have fallen, I may have built this great city, but I have yet to bring any lasting peace to my people.”
“So this witch, Corina, is the source of these chimeras and you also want peace in the tunnels?” Grummin asked.
“Indeed Grummin, we wish to stop the bloodshed. But we must also protect our own when threatened.” Aizen spoke firmly but then paused for a moment to catch his breath. “Old age is catching up with me.” Another short pause, “Perhaps now, with you Grummin, we will be able to put an end to this fighting and begin talks of true peace.”
Grummin’s heart was bursting with excitement. He came into the roden territory expecting resistance and a fight. He instead found similar opinions to his own from their leader no less. In a way he felt more at home here then he did among the draconians. 
“Now we simply need to explain the situation to my uncle and the assassins and we can stop all this bloodshed.” Grummin spoke optimistically.
The King didn’t look so hopeful, “The draconians have never previously been interested in talks of peace. The one exception was your father. We engaged in many meetings and shared a good few laughs in my younger days.”
Grummin agreed with Aizen's observation of the draconians. “You’re right, we may still need to evacuate. Then I can act as a diplomat and we can establish a dialogue between our people.” 
There was some discussion among the roden, but the general tone felt positive. It was clear that many of the roden here were women and children. Quite possibly the chief’s many offspring. Grummin looked around, he didn’t share the racial hatred of the new warden regime. He believed most of his kin were kind and capable of living in peace. It would be hard to convince his uncle, it would likely end in a fight.
Grummin took a deep breath, enough talk, time for action, “We need to start evacuating now. It won’t be long before the wardens arrive. They plan to murder every single roden here. How quickly can we get your people to safety?”
Aizen paused for a moment, in thought, “It may take some time to gather our people together. But even still, where would you have us go, this is our home?” 
Grummin didn’t know where they could go. They would have to move outward from the center of the tunnels. But the outer tunnels still had many feral creatures dwelling within them. Grummin couldn’t lead women and children into the mouths of monsters.
Grummin decided, “Then our only course of action is to stop their attack here. We’ll need any and all fighters you have ready at the entrances. When the assassins arrive they will hit quickly. We must be ready at all points of entry.”
Aizen thought about this tactic, “You may be right. Will you lead our soldiers Grummin?” 
Grummin was honoured. In five minutes with the roden he had already become a general. He’d been with the wardens for years now and was still no higher rank than new recruits.
Grummin responded to the Aizen’s question, “Yes. I will lead your people.” Grummin could tell there was some unrest about this statement. So he added, “And I swear on my father’s grave, I will save you. I will bring peace to the tunnels!” 
With that there were a few cheers in the room. The roden began to rally around Grummin when suddenly and very high pitched squeal came from outside in the hole. It was the sound of a roden screaming and it was suddenly cut short.

            <Title>BugBot's Adventure Vol.1</Title>
            <Text>Back at Ren's office, the small metal creature known as BugBot was wreaking havoc throughout the building. Ren's boss Stephen, his lackey Carson, and a few other wizards have been chasing this little guy for nearly an hour. BugBot mission was twofold; collect data and don’t get caught. 
	The wooden machinery that made up the bulk of BugBot’s frame was very intricate. BugBot was the third generation of Beedel’s design. The first two generations failed their first missions, ending in destruction for the little creatures. 
	At this point BugBot’s pursuers were beginning to keep up to his movements. Much of the upper floors of the office had been scorched from their fire rays. Now near the lower floors, another round of hide and seek had begun. 
BugBot’s goal was now to escape to the tunnels. With all the commotion it would be near impossible for BugBot to hook up to the network as planned. 
For the moment it was quiet on the first floor. BugBot had chewed through the floor to get to the lower levels of the building. However BugBot knew chewing would take too long against the thick concrete between the basement and first floor. 
Just sa BugBot was formulating a new plan, Stephen and Carson came bursting through the ceiling. It seems they found the small hole BugBot had made and choose to create their own bigger hole to save time. BugBot had to move quickly to avoid being crushed. Thankfully moving quickly was one of BugBot’s strengths. BugBot swiftly dodged all the oncoming debris and began to scurry away hoping to avoid being spotted.
Unfortunately,mid fall,  Carson’s keen eye noticed the dark wood of BugBot’s limbs zoom across the floor. Carson shouted to Stephen, “Found the little bastard!” 
Once they’d landed Carson pointed out his finger gun, ready to  shoot. BugBot hadn’t found proper cover and was unprepared to dodge the blast. It would have hit him if Stephen hadn’t suddenly got up and pushed Carson out of his way. Carson was knocked over and his fire blast went shooting towards the the back wall of the room. That blasts were growing larger as BugBot’s pursuers grew more frustrated. Their concern for the well being of the building was diminishing quickly.
BugBot scuttled around while calculating his escape path. His small red orb eye laid upon the door to the lift. The doors themselves weren’t that strong and the lift would most definitely would have access to the tunnels, it was decided, but how to open them. BugBot’s circuitry ran for a few more cycles and then it formed its plan. 
Meanwhile both Stephen and Carson had resumed hunting. Their hands, and spells, were at the ready. Some of the wizards of the floor watched with curiosity, others try to ignore the noise and continue their work.
BugBot was cornered, the elevator was behind his enemies. He slowly approached his pursuers hoping to sneak through their legs. But again Carson spotted him a quick call to Stephen pulled his attention towards BugBot. 
There was a short standoff between the three of them. BugBot stood motionless on it’s six thin legs. Stephen and Carson each pointed their fingers slightly to the side of BugBot covering him from escaping to either side. However what they didn’t expect was for little BugBot to charge them directly instead of running away.
As soon as BugBot started to move, both Stephen and Carson began shooting. It was blast after blast, but each one missed, BugBot had thrown them off by charging them directly.
As BugBot approach the two wizards, he scurried up some of the debris and jumped through the gap between them. The trajectory was well calculated and would place BugBot almost exactly in front of the lift doors.
As BugBot began his jump, neither wizard stopped blasting. They followed his path through the air. Each blast always just slightly behind the wooden creature. It was almost too late when Carson realized that BugBot’s trajectory would place the creature directly between himself and Stephen. Carson was able to stop shooting and he tried to duck out of the way as Stephen continued blasting. But Stephen was rage blind and didn’t even notice when he sent Carson flying into the nearby cubicles, toppling some of the short walls. 
Even after torching Carson, Stephen continued blasting after BugBot. This was all part of BugBot’s plan B. One of Stephen’s final fire blasts had hit the lift door and created a small opening that BugBot could take advantage of. Plan A was that they would have shot each other and BugBot would be free to take  a few moments to chew a hole in the door. But the results of plan B worked nicely too.
BugBot was quick to tear at the hole making it just big enough for it to fit through. Stephen finally realized that he’d just fallen into a trap and cursed, “Fucking bot!”
BugBot scurried on it’s merry way down the shaft of the lift. It’s goal now to get far away from the pursuers and reunite with Beedel. BugBot also considered trying to find another terminal to connect to, maybe it could still get some information for it’s creator.

            <Title>Old Bonds</Title>
            <Text>The lift doors opened to the tunnels and the first thing Ren saw was a familiar face covered in blood.
“Hello Ren.” The warden said. The voice did not yet have that raspy quality that all draconians acquired in their manhood. It was hard to tell by looking at his face, but this draconian was young. Barely a teenager by draconian standards. Yet he was a skilled fighter. 
“Hello Grummin, long time.” Ren knew this draconian. Grummin's father, Bezelnorf the Slayer had been the first warden.
Seeing Grummin after so long reminded Ren of the times when his father would have Bezelnorf over as a guest in their home. Silver Magic had also been widely known for his fighting ability. When Bezelnorf wasn’t single handedly fighting off the monsters down in the tunnels, it was Silver who stood beside him.
The day before Ren's father left, Bezelnorf had come to the house. Grummin was with him, but Grummin was still a small baby at the time. Even as a baby Grummin’s tusks were impressive. The three of them went into the workshop together but Ren wasn’t allowed to follow. He had wanted to observe the little draconian baby some more. Ren was a child at the time and had he known it would be the last day with his father he might have done things differently.
Ever since then Bezelnorf had occasionally looked after Ren. Grummin grew up with Ren as an older brother. They hadn’t seen each other much lately, but seeing Grummin now, so suddenly, brought back a lot of painful memories. Although Ren was also relieved. He missed Grummin’s odd charm.
Grummin smiled, “Brother, I’ve missed you.” As the smile morphed into a mischievous smirk, Grummin lifted a pair of shackles. Ren wasn’t phased, this was protocol after all. 
Whenever a Wizard was sent through the tunnels to a Commissioner, it commonly meant they were being expelled from the association. It wasn’t uncommon for many wizards to flee during the trip, stealing association technology when they did.
“I’m ready. Let’s get this over with.” Ren offered his wrists.
“Drop the game Ren. There’s no cameras down here. We can leave them off until we get to close to the Tower.” 
“Grum,” Ren inquired, “Why is it that you’re the one escorting me?” The higher ups knew about their relationship so Ren was curious why they had arranged this, they usually tried to avoid mixing family with any task, no matter how simple. 
“We’ve been busy like hell down here.” Grummin’s voice was starting to get impatient. He signalled Ren to step out of the lift. Ren did so and they continued their chat while they walked.
“I can see that. You look… busy.” Ren tried to speak authoritatively, as an older brother should. But he was also legitimately afraid of Grummin’s ferocity and made pains to avoid disrespecting him. Ren had seen Grummin snap on a couple of occasions. All his calm would leave Grummin faster than you could apologize, and then you’d be dealing with his fists.
“Yeah, it’s been a few days. Seems the roden have taken a liking to chimerism.” Grummin replied.
“They broke the treaty?” Ren asked.
“I’m not sure. They would be the only ones with the means to accomplish this kind of magic.”
“Are we in danger?” Ren dreaded the idea of encountering a frankenstein beast which contained all the worse portions of all his different nightmares.
“Shouldn’t be. I just did another sweep of this area. Cleared out the last couple stragglers as I came to pick you up. But most of the fighting is aimed directly at our headquarters.” Grummin’s confidence was a welcome change for Ren, however it didn’t quite soothe him. Every 20 meters or so they passed by another corridor and there was no way Grummin had efficiently checked each possible hiding hole in the area. Ren wished he had his gun.
“Great.” Ren's lack of faith was transparent.
“It’s alright Ren, even if I missed one or two, they’re just tiny creatures. I can take care of it.” Grummin sometimes acted more like the big brother. Draconians grew up quick, they needed to, or else they didn’t survive their family’s training regime. That went triple for the son of the first warden. 
Grummin continued to explain the situation, unaware that the story would only make Ren's fears grow, “The problem began as hundreds of these little fuckers started swarming the tunnels. It took us hours to stop them the first time. But wave after wave continued to show up. It’s been three days.” Grummin paused, thinking. Then he continued, “I overheard Krozan and some seniors talking about an assault on the roden. I’m nervous Ren.”
“An extermination?” The words had jumped out of Ren's mouth. It was delicate topic. Grummin looked up to meet Ren's eyes and stopped walking. Ren took a couple more steps before stopping as well. Grummin’s eyes were full of sadness.
“Not if I can help it.” Ren grasped Grummin’s impatience. Although he was one of the most skilled wardens, Grummin was still low on the warden’s political ladder. His ideas and opinions were still disrespected. That’s how things worked in the wardens. Being the son of the founder gave him no advantage. 
After Grummin’s father passed away it was his younger brother Krozan who took over control of the wardens. Bezelnorf had lived for many years beyond what was expected of the average draconian. Throwing himself into the fray of battle daily, it was a surprise when the beast that finally took him down, was a common virus.
Ren had to ask, “So they sent you to pick me up to keep you out of their way?” 
It was a difficult question for Grummin to answer, “Yes, Ren. So if you don’t mind I’d like to hurry.” Ren got the hint and upped his speed and Grummin matched his pace.
Grummin asked, “ So why are you being commissioned?”
“I’m not too sure.” Ren replied.
Grummin cocked an eyebrow, “Really? Sure you weren’t pissing someone off.”
“Not this time, but I do think a coworker has it out for me.”
“So this should be a quick meeting then?”
“Don’t know Grum.” Ren shrugged. “Let’s hope it’s not too quick.”
“Yeah.” Grummin’s attention was leaving their conversation.
Ren tried to force a laugh and wished that it would be a simple reprimand and nothing more. The silence grew over them as they walked through the tunnels.
The wardens were almost entirely ranked full of draconians. It was a rarity that any other species even wanted to join the wardens and even many draconians chose the easy life on the surface. The wardens spent almost all their hours underground fighting all sorts of bizarre creatures. It was a rough life, and draconians made up some of the toughest people. Still it was only the toughest among them who joined the ranks of warden.
In the past, Bezelnorf primarily used fear tactics in order to scare off all the unwanted creatures that called the tunnels home. He would only ever use kill if there was no other option. Eventually as the wardens grew it became too large an organization for Bezelnorf to control on his own. His brother, Krozan volunteered to help him lead, along with a few others of their kin.
As is the case with any organised group of people, there were power struggles and differences in opinion. Bezelnorf wished to continue using scare tactics to avoid serious conflicts. Where as many of the other leaders wanted to act more aggressively, driving out the scum once and for all. As time went on Bezelnorf lost control and more leaders kept siding with the aggressives. 
One night, without Bezelnorf’s consent the other leaders planned a campaign to end the fighting once and for all. They infiltrated the infested parts of the tunnels and slaughtered every living thing they could find. Bezelnorf was devastated. 
What Bezelnorf understood was that it was they who were the invaders. Many species had made homes in these tunnels for decades. They were simply defending their homes. Bezelnorf knew that the tunnels went far beyond the need of the Wizard association so his tactic was to simply push the creatures outward where they could live happily while the wizards made use of the tunnels nearer to the city center. The other leaders didn’t see it that way. They saw the tunnel’s residents as pests to be exterminated. 
After that massacre the creatures of the tunnels began deliberately hunting out the wardens. The tunnels were a war zone for years. But all that was well before Ren and Grummin’s time. Now the fights had subsided. The wardens’s forces have regrown significantly. The tunnels were the safest they’ve ever been. 
Ren and Grummin walked silently for a great time. Both thinking of something to say but then dropping it, feeling the awkwardness of the emotional distance between them.
Grummin was of the same opinion as his father. That they had no right to destroy an entire species simply because they wanted the tunnels for themselves. Both Bezelnorf and Grummin wanted control of the tunnels, they simply didn’t want to go along with the extermination orders. Grummin was continuing his father’s work. 
As Bezelnorf lay in bed, near death, he told his own his dying wish. Ren was there, as were many of the Irontooth clan. Bezelnorf had a large family, but only one son. Grummin was Bezelnorf’s shining star. Ren didn’t get to hear the words Bezelnorf spoke into his only son’s ear. But the passion was strong in Grummin from that day forth. Ren always assumed Bezelnorf said something like; stop the killings, or save the children. Whatever it was, Ren was sure it was something dramatic, as that was Bezelnorf’s way of speaking. Especially considering it was his last words, anything else would have be anticlimactic. Bezelnorf would have none of that.
Grummin never shared those final words with anyone. But after that day he joined the wardens and began speaking out about ending the fighting. Assured that there could be peace in the tunnels. He’s worked tirelessly to bring a better understanding to not only the leaders but all wardens. Here’s received a good deal of push back for it as well. Especially from his uncle Krozan. 
Krozan uses guised language to hide the fact that he simply enjoys the killing. Krozan could care less about the rights of roden or other creatures. Krozan was also the main force holding Grummin down the political ladder. Bezelnorf was loved and respected, once his son gained power Krozan knew things would eventually go Grummin’s way. Grummin had a confident charisma that helped people see his side of things. Many wardens also believed Grummin was morally right. But due to fear of ridicule, most kept their mouths shut and did as they were told. 
At this point Ren and Grummin had been walking for nearly 15 minutes in silence. Ren wasn’t exactly sure how long it would take to get to the Wizard Tower, he had never gone there through the tunnels. They had taken several turns along the way. Ren thought himself good with directions but down here none of that mattered. The complex geography and pathways which split off at obscure angles made things very hazy. 
Ren often wondered if there was any spatial warping going on down here. Somehow you always managed to get to where you needed to go faster than if you travelled there using the surface streets. It could be due to the lack of traffic and crowds. Avoiding those was a benefit own it’s own, but somehow the zigzagged tunnels still got you there much faster than expected.
Ren was sufficiently lost and the silence had been sufficiently long. He thought he’d try to strike up conversation. After all this was his brother in bond who he hadn’t seen in several moons. “So Grum, have you tried…” 
Ren was cut off by a loud crashing sound coming from a nearby split off. Grummin took a defensive stance, “Ren, stay behind me.” Grummin wore very little armour. Some loose padded leather covered most of his vital spots and he also wore what looked like the top half of a metal plate armour. It only covered his chest, and shoulders. He also wore heavy metal boots and very similar metal arm bracers. All of his armour pieces were made from the same high grade steel and they all shared similar markings. Flat black stripes swirled  up and down the armour. 
Ren recognized that these stripes were the channels for energizing power armour, he had seen similar marking on Beedel’s armour.. Grummin flicked both his arms out to either side of him. The action snapped his bracers into action and they slid down his arms and formed into a pair of gauntlets. As the gauntlets snapped and clanged together, Grummin took his stance. It was low and animalistic. Grummin was a brawler, he didn’t use any magic except that which was used by his armour. Any armour that was worth a damn these days had some form of magical enhancement. Ren also grabbed his Crystal and loaded a few rudimentary spells. Just in case. 
The magical pressure in the room was shifting. This surprised Ren, but Grummin didn’t seem to notice. His eyes were transfixed unto the doorway, ready for whatever might come through. The majority of the tunnels had more than a few newly installed power pipes running along the walls and ceiling. These pipes swirled with colour. Most of these pipes were no wider than a bottle of wine, but there were several going to and coming from each hallway they had passed. The power pipes added a some well needed lighting. Without the alternating colours emitted by the pipes these tunnels would be pitch black and much more ominous.
The change in pressure was likely caused by crack in one of the pipes. When these pipes broke it created a sort of energy draft. Ren could feel the pressure coming from the same hallway that Grummin was fixated onto. He thought a small warning might benefit Grummin in case that crack got worse. Just before he found the words, Ren could swear he heard voices from that hallway. When he looked at Grummin he could tell that Grummin heard them too.
That’s when the pressure got a whole lot worse. Ren called out to Grummin to get back, but before he could the pipe burst. Colourful energy blasted from the hallway. Smoke, rubble, and discharge followed it. Ren got knocked down by the blast. He wasn’t hurt, but he was on his ass. Grummin however was still standing.
As the flames and smoke dispersed, another figure emerged from the hall. Ren was stunned to see a familiar set of armour flailing it’s arms at the smoke. The face plate was open on the armour and Ren could identify it was indeed Beedel. The sought from the blast had covered his armour. The pristine armour that had visited him last night looked in rough shape. 
Beedel was jumping about trying to avoid the leftover electrical discharge as he yelled down the hall he had come from, “That’s the last time I help you out Skeeter! No more pastries on from the market!”
Ren thought he could hear someone yelling back at Beedel from the hall, but couldn’t quite make it out. Beedel continued, “Yeah, yeah, just get out of here. We’ll talk later.” Beedel turned back to notice the large draconian standing in battle position staring him down. Ren thought he better step in, no sense having these two fight each other.
Beedel started addressing Grummin, “Hello mister warden sir, sorry about the mess. It appears my guide got me a bit lost. You see I’m looking for…” He trailed off as he noticed Ren getting up off of the ground behind Grummin. “Oh! Ren there you are.”
Ren was a little disheartened to see Beedel again. “Beedel what you doing here? I’m working.” Ren was trying to move this along quickly, he knew Grummin was already irritated. No need to drag this out.
Grummin asked, “Ren do you know this armoured plant?” Grummin hadn’t dropped his guard stance, even though Beedel had and Ren was now walking forward to get closer to Beedel.
“I do Grummin, he means no harm. I think.” Ren was pretty sure that Beedel was an ally. He wasn’t about to take any chances though as he still stayed closer to Grummin’s side.
“I got some bad news, Ren.” Beedel was excited. Maybe frantic. Ren couldn’t really tell. “My house Ren, it’s gone.”
 “What do you mean it’s gone Beedel?” Ren suddenly remembered Stephen’s words. About how Beedel was accused of black magic and how many wizards were hurt. “You hurt those wizards.”
“Ren you know if they found what I was working on that they’d kill me. I had to destroy everything and some people did get hurt.” Beedel was desperate Ren could hear it in his voice. Something big had changed since last night.
Grummin wasn’t following and really he wasn’t trying to. He kept his eyes on Beedel. Looking for any vicious intent, ready to pounce.
Ren was still trying to determine what had happened. “Beedel, why was I told that you were doing black magic.”  As Ren said it, he knew. He was lied to. It was most likely that Stephen was also lied to. This conspiracy started making too much sense for Ren's comfortability.
Beedel was getting impatient too, “I ain’t no black mage, Renny you gotta believe me.” At the name Renny Grummin finally broke out of his fully defensive stance for a moment to look toward Ren. Grummin knew Ren hated that name.
Although the moment Grummin turned his head Beedel rushed forward swords drawn. Beedel was lightning fast, the thrusters on the back of the armour took most of the credit for that. 
However Grummin’s fighting reflexes were quick too. He blocking several sword blows with his gauntlets. The sounds of metal on metal echoed through the tunnels. Ren could barely keep up with their movements.
Suddenly Beedel’s thrusters shifted to the front of his armour and he blasted himself backwards. Likewise Grummin jumped back with a few powerful leaps. That did nothing to quiet the tension in the air because both fighters just displayed that such distanced were trivial to them.
Ren was stunned, he trusted Beedel. He was ready to yell out when Beedel beat him to it, “Ren, this draconian is bringing you to your death. You must not follow him to the Tower!”
“Grummin would never betray me like that.” Grummin was silent, Ren tried to ignore that. “He’s my friend.” 
“Ren.” Beedel tried to calm his voice. “Do you know what happens to wizards who fail to report black mages?” Beedel rolled his eyes, “Even alleged black mages.”
The fact that Beedel knew so much about the situation was what disturbed Ren the most. That’s when Grummin decided to chime in, he wasn’t particularly focused on the conversation, draconians tended to have a one track mind and Grummin’s mind was entirely focused on a powerful enemy. “Ren how do you know this Arborian?”
Ren was still trying to deal with Beedel’s question, but he felt getting Grummin under control was the priority here. He wanted to avoid any bloodshed, “Don’t fight him Grum. He’s a friend. Now Beedel what…”
Grummin interrupted, “I don’t take orders from you Ren!” As Grummin spoke he threw his arms out to his side again. Grummin began charging his magic through his gear. The black stripes on his armour began to glow red. The colour was dull at first but after just a few seconds of Grummin flexing his power into it, the faint glow quickly ignited into fiery bursts of colour.
Beedel took a defensive stance in response to Grummin’s charged armour almost as soon as Grummin began charging. He was fast, Ren noticed, almost like his father used to be with a gun. Ren's father would often read the situation with little more than a momentary glance. It was all but impossible to catch Silver Magic off-guard. Beedel wasn’t that fast, but close.
Beedel brought both of his arms together in front of him. With a sword in each hand he pushed them together and the two swords began to merge into one. The actions were hard to follow. So many little intricate moving parts working in perfect unison. Once the swords had finished their dance, the hilt began glowing. And outward from the hilt a blast of blue light came shooting along the blade and remained along the edge of the blade.
Ren could tell Beedel was injecting a good deal of energy into his balde. The light itself was wavy. Moving up and down the blade in sharp patterns. The thrusters on the back of the armour opened up as well. The blue flames they emitted were set to a low roar. This was to facilitate the activation, it would save Beedel only a fraction of a second, but that could mean the difference in a battle at this pace.
Both fighters stood their silently for a moment sizing each other up. Ren felt utterly useless to stop them. Nor did he want to physically put himself between them. “Please stop it. Grummin. Beedel. Why are you even fighting right now?” At first Ren wasn’t sure they even heard him. 
Grummin was the first to respond, “The shrub attacked me.” Grummin eyes never left contact with Beedel’s.
Likewise when Beedel spoke he didn’t break eye contact. However whereas Grummin was full of seriousness and rage, Beedel was getting excited to test his new armour upgrades. “I only attacked you to save Renny from the path you’re leading him towards.” There was small pause, then he continued, accusingly at Grummin, “You don’t even know do you?”
Grummin snapped back at him, “I do not need to know the consequences of my orders to carry them out.”
Beedel had a natural way of getting people to say near to exactly what he wanted them to, “Ren don’t you see he’s just another goon for those high wizards. Go ahead and ask him if he’s ever brought a wizard back from a commissioner.” Another silence. Ren was looking towards Grummin, waiting for a response. Grummin moved his eyes very slightly toward Ren, while keeping a visual on Beedel. 
Beedel pushed again, “Go on then warden, tell him.”
Ren added, “Grum?”
“That’s true Ren. But it doesn’t mean that they died.” Grummin didn’t know enough to sound confident in the matter. As much as he’d hate to admit it, he was a dog, running blindly into whatever danger his superiors would have asked him to.
Ren starting working his memory. It was incredibly rare for any wizard to return to their job after seeing a commissioner. It was mostly assumed they’d been fired or quit or something, but could many of them have been silenced. It would explain why Ren was so suddenly sentenced to the commissioners if they suspected him to have any connection at all to Beedel.  Now that the details were in front of him, it made sense. Ren was starting to hate it when Beedel made sense.
Beedel interrupted his train of thought, “They kill the wizards who know too much.” 
Ren suddenly realized, he knew too much.
“Ren they know we talked, I’m not sure how they figured it out but they did and you’re no longer safe on your own.”
Ren knew Beedel was right but the fear began surrounding him, “What I am supposed to do Beedel?” Ren was spiralling into a panic attack. 
Grummin, who was now observing Ren carefully, thought he should say something, “Ren.” The weight of the word was enough to snap Ren back into the present. Grummin lowered his guard. His power armour began to power down, then he continued only after he was sure he had Ren's attention. “I don’t fully understand what is going on, but if you’re in danger I want to help.”
Ren was regaining control of his mind. Somehow with Grummin on their side Ren felt better. But Ren couldn’t do that to Grummin, he was needed elsewhere. “Grum. Go save the roden.”
Grummin began, “I can stay with you, you’re family, Ren.” Grummin was speaking the words, but the insincerity in his voice was clear. Everything in Grummin’s being was telling him to run now and save the roden before they became nothing more than a page in a history book.
Beedel watched as Ren navigated the social battlefield, he was impressed. Beedel saw a lot of potential in young Renny. Fate must have brought them together for a great reason, at least that was Beedel’s opinion on the matter.
Ren knew that although he would much prefer to have Grummin by his side Grummin was the only one know who could prevent the deaths of thousands of roden. The wardens would be cruel, women and children would suffer the same fate as the fathers, husbands, and brothers who would fight to protect them. Ren really wanted to be selfish, but couldn’t muster up the confidence. “Go Grummin.”
“What about you two?” Grummin was already mentally preparing his route.
Beedel responded, “I’ll keep him safe. We’ll be leaving the city.”
“Tell your superiors,” Ren spoke, “that I ran and escaped with the help of a criminal element.” Ren smirked towards Beedel. Beedel simply smiled back. 
Grummin thought about it for just a moment, but this was merely for show. He had already come to same conclusion, “Alright get moving, and be safe. You’re the only family I have left brother.” 
Ren smiled and said, “Alright, you too. Don’t go getting yourself killed for those rats.”
“I can’t help them if I’m dead.” Grummin was quick to respond then he glanced over to Beedel and spoke to him, “Let’s fight for real some time.”
Beedel had begun to power down his armour and separating his swords. “I would like that.” Beedel gave a great big smile. It made him look very childish. 
Ren and Grummin exchanged a quick embrace. They grabbed each other’s elbows and pulled it in for a hug. Grummin began down one of the corridors when he stopped to ask, “Do you know your way out,” he paused to think of his name, “Beedel?”
Beedel responded, “Yes, that’s right. Until next time Grum.”
“It’s Grummin. Grummin Irontooth.”
“Beedel Circuitwood.”
“Good Luck Beedel.”
“Goodluck Grum.” Beedel had to hold back a laugh as Grummin turned and ran down the corridor. He thought to himself that these two brothers were very much alike. Now he had to get Ren to safety. 
“C'mon Renny, let’s move.” Ren followed Beedel without hesitation. Some might say that Ren was much too trusting of someone who just recently broke into his house. But when you’ve been fired from your job, have no family, and your whole world view has been shaken most people will try to attach themselves to anything that makes sense. Right now the only thing that made sense to Ren was Beedel.
Speaking of information, “Beedel.” Ren began, “How do you know your way around these tunnels?” 
“I have a friend who helped me. Skeeter. He led me here. I should be able to navigate us backwards out though.” The lack of confidence was concerning to Ren, but he thought to give Beedel the benefit of the doubt. Beedel hadn’t seen him wrong yet. Unless of course you counted, breaking down his doors and almost killing him, getting him fired from his stable job, and almost getting him sent to the commissioners and potentially killed. 
Ren didn’t seem to care much though. A part of him was excited for the changes. Of course he always outwardly claimed to want a comfortable and boring life. But Ren secretly wanted adventure, he just didn’t want to deal with the scary bits involved with adventures. But now that life had thrown him furiously into the heat of a conspiracy with a strange friend. Ren thought he could keep up for a while. See things through to the end. Ren suspected he would eventually come to regret this, but it really was too late to turn back now.

            <Title>Punishing Tardiness</Title>
            <Text>Ren managed to make it to work only a couple hours late. As he approached the office he made note of the Wizard Tower. The top of the Wizard Tower was the headquarters all of things wizardly in the city. An open spiral architecture surrounded the base of the arcane flame that sprouted from out the top. Ren didn’t know what the upper floors of the Tower were for, but he knew that like most of the buildings in this area the Wizard Tower contained a great many offices.
Ren's office and nearly all the surrounding buildings, belonged to the wizard association. Like some kind of university, all for the purpose of generating power. Some buildings housed wizards while others were used for schooling. Most served as some minor form of support to the great Wizard Tower where the real magic happened. 
	Ren found himself  thinking of the grand wizards and Beedel’s story. He stopped that train of thought as he approached his office. He would further investigate the matter with his superiors at a later time, when he was a little more emotionally stable. He was confident the explanation would become clear. For now he just needed to do some tedium to regain his equilibrium. Ren truly enjoyed his work. Auditing was boring in most respects, but the repetitive nature of the work calmed him.
	His office was a plain four story building. Not many windows and the decor was abysmal. Mostly grey furniture. For wizards you’d think things would be a bit more colourful. One interesting feature was that it had underground connections to the nearby buildings. All of the buildings in the Wizard Association were connected via these tunnels. However there were no direct paths and it took years of training to become efficient at navigation. Those trained in this very specific purpose were called the wardens. The wardens were also skilled fighters, which was necessary. The occasional mutant Dredger uprising, or the frequent molemen attacks kept the wardens quite busy.
	Ren had been down through the tunnels many times. The quickest route to his favorite bakery was through the eastward tunnel from his office. This specific route of the tunnels was usually monster free. However he had once run into a group of wardens fighting off some sort of slimy monstrosity. He lent them a hand and got to know one or two of the wardens. As far as Ren was concerned they weren’t as bad as most wizards thought. Wizards tended to look down upon them as necessary savages. Although most wizards also refused to go through the tunnels without a at least one warden as an escorts.
	Ren paused outside the office doors. He wondered if he’d be able to sneak in. “Julia might have covered for me.” Ren thought about calling her but then remembered she’s at the tower now. “Fuck.” Ren realized that without Julia, Carson would definitely notice his absence, which meant Stephen knew too.
	Ren entered the office carrying his bag on one shoulder and inside BugBot was busy scanning the area. The construct lay in wait for a good time to spring into action.
	Everything inside the office was normal. Everything from the trip up to the fourth floor to the walk to his desk seemed perfectly normal. But a feelings of dread crept into Ren. Something was wrong, no one had said a word to him. Ren had just put his jacket on the coat hook in his cubicle and placed his bag on the floor when he noticed Stephen standing just behind him.
“Shit Steve, don’t sneak up on me like that.” Ren was disappointed at the lack of a laugh or at least a small show of emotion out of Stephen.
Stephen’s looming quality began to show itself, “Ren. You’re late Ren. Again.” His voice was cold. “This kind of behaviour is harmful to the association.”
Ren tried to remain respectful of his superior, “I’m really sorry Stephen, I’ll work late tonight. I’ll be set up and ready to start in just a minutes.”
Ren thought for a moment that he saw some sympathy in Stephen’s eyes, but then Stephen spoke, “I’m sorry Ren. You’re going to need to see a commissioner.”
Ren was shocked. Commissioners were the punitive judge, jury, and prosecution of the Wizard Association. Most wizards didn’t leave the meeting with a job. He had been a star employee except for a handful of late arrivals. 
“A commissioner? Just because I was late?” Ren asked. As he did he spotted Carson on the other side of the office watching them intently with a huge grin.
“No Ren,” Stephen’s voice cut him down, “Not only is this your seventh infringement of our tardiness policy but you also messed up last night.” 
“I don’t… uh…” Ren tried to think of an explanation. 
“Enough Ren.” Stephen interrupted. “This is because of the spike last night. You said you’d check it out. But it turned out to be a source of black magic. A big one.” 
“Beedel?” Ren muttered.
Stephen ignored him, “We sent out a team. But it was too late, many wizards were hurt. It just makes things worse for you that you were late today. The commissioner has been waiting.”
Ren was confused. Could Beedel have been lying to him. It surely made more sense then all that other business. Ren pleaded, “Stephen please, you know I’m a good worker, I don’t deserve this.”
Stephen grabbed Ren's bag from the ground and held it out to him, “It’s out of my hands now Ren. Go answer the questions and maybe we’ll see you tomorrow.” 
Ren reached for his bag. But to his shock, he noticed a wooded claw reaching out from the top. Stephen noticed Ren's confusion and turned the bag around to look himself. Quick as lightning, the little creature scuttled up Stephen’s arm. He screamed. 
By now the few employees who hadn’t been watching the scene, had gotten up from their desks to look over their cubicle walls. Stephen’s reflexes were quick and he snatched the creature just as it jumped away from his body. “What is this Ren?”
“I have no idea.” Ren replied.
“Ren, we do not bring toys into the office.” Stephen’s anger had calmed for a moment just as BugBot bit his fingers. It was less like a bite and more like a pinch between two wooden maws, but either way, it was painful enough that Stephen had yelled out in pain and dropped it. That’s exactly what BugBot wanted, the construct then ran swiftly around the cubicle’s corners. 
Stephen reactively grabbed his Crystal and cast a destructive spell, “Ignitus!” The flame shot out from his Crystal at a pace that would rival one of Ren's bullets but Stephen was not quick enough. It burned a small patch of carpet, the scent filled Ren's nostrils and he coughed the stink away. 
BugBot had scurried under some furniture and it was now out of sight. Stephen approached a nearby drawer with predatory caution. He was holding his Crystal in his left hand and his right was pointed with both his index and middle fingers like a gun. Ren had seen Stephen do this before, as far as Ren knew it didn’t have any affect on the magic, but maybe it helped Stephen aim.
Ren had never heard such silence in this room before. There was always someone on the phone, or sending a message, or casting a spell. Stephen slowly bent to the ground and the silence grew deeper. Stephen’s Crystal was charged and ready for several more blasts of fire. As soon as his head was low enough to see under the drawer he cursed, “Shit!” Stephen had noticed a small fresh hole in the wall behind the drawer.
Stephen rose up quickly off of the ground and his eyes met Ren's. Ren could see the rage building in Stephen’s eyes. Stephen took a deep breath and then yelled out, “CARSON!”
As the silence was now broken and most of the wizards knew to get back to work rather than face any of Stephen’s wrath. It only took Carson a few seconds to find his way, he’d been waiting to be beckoned. 
To his master Carson was subservient and absolutely loyal, but to almost everyone else in the office, Carson was a monster. He was gunning for a promotion, Stephen’s role was in his sights. It all depended on whether or not Stephen would ever get called to the Wizard Tower, Carson seemed happy to wait.
Carson stopped on a dime right at Stephen’s side. He gave a quick smirk toward Ren and began to address his master’s needs, “Yes, Stephen?”
Stephen tried to restrain his anger when talking to Carson, every word spoken as if it’s own sentence, “Find. That. Little. Bug. And smash it!” 
Carson quickly understood his task. Search and destroy. Carson took a quick look around. He made note of the small scorch mark on the carpet. Then he dropped to the floor and found the hole in the wall rather quickly. Carson jumped back up to his feet. He gripped his Crystal and mimicked Stephen’s finger gun stance.
Stephen turned his attention back to Ren, “Go to the basement. There’s a warden waiting.” 
“Yes sir.” Ren replied as he rolled his eyes. He began his way towards to lift. He watched as several of his co-wizards look around, confused. None really cared to say anything, no one cared that he was leaving. 
The office itself wasn’t  very large, there was maybe thirty or so people inside, including Carson frantically searching around the room. Stephen hand joined him. Both of their hands raised with that completely unnecessary technique. To Ren they appeared as children playing a game.
Ren hit the button to call the lift. It would only take a moment or two for it to arrive. As he waited he heard the bug hunters shouting and shooting. 
“Found it! Under that chair!”
“Which chair?”
“The one right beside your leg!”
“Which leg?”
More blasts. Ren lost track of their voices. A few other wizards joined in. Ren was quite surprised that little wooden creature was lasting so long. And he wondered how it found its way into his bag.
“I lost it.”
“It went this way!”
Ren began silently cheering for the little guy. Something familiar about the look of it made him sympathetic. The lift arrived and the doors slid open. Ren walked into the small room that would transport him down into the tunnels. He hoped that it would be a warden he knew. A battle story or two might cheer him up.
As he stood waiting for the doors to close he saw the chaos in the room slowly grow. Ren wondered how one little thing could cause such a mess. A couple spots in the room had actually caught fire now and there were more than a few wizards running around every which way. Some were trying to kill the bug. Others wanted to avoid the blasts. Some just wanted to be left alone with their work, like Ren.
The saddest part, Ren realized as the doors were closing on the chaotic scene, was that he wasn’t able to do any auditing. He sighed.

            <Title>The Morning After</Title>
            <Text>Ren awoke, mostly due to discomfort. His pull-out couch mattress was no prize winner, but whenever he slept on the cushions it made everything ache. Adding to the pain, his arm had somehow gotten lodged behind his head. His eyes hurt. His head hurt. Everything hurt. This couch would get the best of him. He briefly thought about fetching the real bed from the house. But Ren had pretty much refused to go in there except when absolutely necessary.
	Ren's memory of the night before was fuzzy. He almost believed that the intruding armoured treeman with plans to topple the government was all just some bad dream. Almost believed it. The rubble of the two inner doorways quickly reconfirmed the events of the night before. Ren sighed.
	Ren looked around. He considered making a couple eggs for breakfast. Maybe take it easy, do some crafting. and go over the details of Beedel’s story. He was about to stand up and get the day moving forward when the thought hit him. Today was a work day. He checked the clock. And he was late. “Just great.” Ren muttered. The last thing he needed was his boss on his back about another late start.
	Ren groomed his hair back with his hands. It really only made things worse with his mid length shaggy brown hair, but Ren wasn’t trying to impress anyone. He grabbed a tube of breakfast from the small fridge. He  was halfway out the door before he remembering to grab his work bag. He rushed back passed the collapsed doorways, and passed the extinguished forge. His workbench was still a mess. Ren had a lot of work to do after work.
	He reached for the bag, pulled it over his shoulder.. If Ren had been paying more attention he might have noticed the small wooden creature occasionally moving around the inside of his bag. 
Just as Ren was turning to leave the room he heard a weird thud against the far wall. If he had been facing the window he might have noticed the faint purple glow of magic too. Ren thought about it for a moment. He approached the window, but he couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary. He shrugged it off as some daft animal.
	Ren quickly rushed to the front door. If he hurried he may be able to sneak in without anyone noticing his tardiness. As he rushed out the door. He stopped and looked back. He rarely locked his door, but something in him thought it might be a good idea to start. 
Maybe a small lesson learned from last night’s experience. Although even a magical lock wouldn’t have stopped Beedel’s power armour from bursting through the door.
	Ren reassured himself that perhaps Beedel was just a crazy Arborian who’s abused a substance or two. Or on the other hand, maybe black mages really were hunting him. Ren didn’t want to get involved either way. But somehow he felt he wouldn’t be able to avoid Beedel now that he knew his secrets. 
Ren sighed again and then he yawned. He locked the door was a quick spell he knew. Just a simple reinforcement spell. Green light shimmered from his Crystal and jumped towards the door. handle. Finally the light landed into the lock and the whole mechanism glowed green for just a moment. At the apex of the glow Ren could hear a quiet series of locking sounds. Magic was often flashy and noisy. Ren preferred the simpler, less overt kinds, the exception being when it came to his bullets.
	After he locked the door, he took a good look around. In some respects, last night was a near death experience. Ren took the time to really appreciate his world. Simple as it may be, the man liked it that way. There wasn’t much to worry about. 
	Today was a prime day for a new outlook. The skies were that lovely shade of blue. The clouds seemed to be calling out to him, come sleep on us, is what Ren imagined them saying.
	One last sighed, this one of relief. Then Ren was on his way. Even if he was late, Ren felt he could handle the small scolding. Everything would be back to normal before dinner.
	Ren hadn’t notice the unnatural silence as he left his workshop. He was too optimistic to notice such things as that. He had his eyes on the uncharacteristic bright day. Novos was not known to have good weather. Magic had a funny way of distorting the normal flow of things. It made forecasting troublesome. Even still a bright sunny day was a rarity, that was known for sure.
	Soon Ren was gone, completely out of sight. 
	“Finally gone.” Umbra whispered to herself, “This should do for a little while.” Umbra had managed to wander through town disoriented. She now found herself nearby a quiet residential area. To be precise she was outside of Ren's workshop. She had fumbled into the side of the wall earlier and had since used a silencing spell to avoid any unnecessary interactions. Now that Ren was gone she tried the door. It was locked. But this wouldn’t stop her. She loaded a quick spell into her Crystal and the strands of purple counter magic swiftly found their way into the lock. 
	Umbra swung the door open. She needed rest, badly. Her consciousness was fading quickly. She had given it almost everything she had not to pass out in the middle of the street on the way here. That wasn’t a smart thing for a lady to do in the big city. 
She was walking by, when she noticed Ren rushing around frantically inside. When she crept to get a closer look, it appeared that the man inside was rushing to get dressed. She figured he’d be out of there soon, so she waited. Umbra’s hunch paid off.
Now that she was inside his shop, she took a quick look around. The far side doorway was crumbled and the one beyond that as well. She could see the forge equipment in the other room but what grabbed her attention was the sink in this one. She needed water.
Umbra’s abdomen had be sliced open. Everything was still in its proper place, but she needed to get some medical attention asap. If she could only find something to patch herself up, she might be able to make it to the train station and back to Jak’s place. 
The pain was getting worse. She practically waddled over to the sink. She pulled her scarf and hood off. The tap water was discoloured. Chloe’s high class instincts were kicking in, but the survival instincts were stronger and she drank. It was so refreshing. But it didn’t solve her major problem. She found some clothes nearby that she could make into bandages. Looked like dirty laundry on the floor. She grabbed them, nearly passed out as she bent over.
She waited a moment then began ripping but the actions made her dizzy again. She was losing her balance. After stumbling against the counter, she found a few bottles of pills. All off brands, but one she recognized as a pain reducer. She needed to sit. Umbra grabbed the pain meds, and headed for the small couch.
The couch was still warm from Ren's slumber. She collapsed over it. It was struggle to pull herself up onto it. But she managed. She had gotten this far, she thought, she can take these meds and make it home. Sleep this whole thing off.
Chloe was not going to make it home. She was fading fast. She quickly popped a couple pills and swallowed them without water. She wasn’t used to it and it made her gag up a little. She didn’t have a choice at this point, she knew the walk back to the sink might as well have been a canyon to her now. The meds worked quickly, but it wasn’t helping the blood loss. She still had the ripped clothes. She sat up as best she could and began tying them around her wound. She was just getting it around her waist when her hands went numb. 
Chloe’s vision started to fade. Her head felt so light. Like it was just floating on down to the couch cushion. Before she even realized it she was horizontal on the couch. Her whole body was going numb.The last thing Chloe thought of before passing out was that she hoped Jak would forgive her. She screwed up. It was an easy job and she got cocky. Idiot.

            <Title>Beedel's Fight</Title>
            <Text>Beedel was out walking for hours after his talk with Ren. He was fairly disappointed with the outcomes, both that Ren had been scared off and that Beedel had left BugBot behind.
	“I hope he’s ready.” Beedel was nervous about sending BugBot into the system so soon after he’d been awakened. Beedel also hoped his creation wouldn’t cause any trouble for Ren.
Beedel’s walk had been clarifying and he was now heading home, although he was still a quarter hour away. That’s when he noticed the fresh crimson stains splattered onto the street near one of his favourite convenience shops. 
Beedel reacted by taking stance and scanning the nearby area. It was late and the shop was closed and nobody was around. Except, Beedel noticed, a woman in the distance dressed in all black. From what he could tell she was limping and the blood trail looked to lead to her.
“Excuse me miss.” Beedel called out. 
The woman didn’t respond but kept on moving down the street away from him. She appeared to the looking for something. Her head jutting back and forth looking into the shops and houses in the area.
Beedel began to follow her. He noticed her pace began to increase. “Are you alright? I’m not going to hurt you.”
The woman tried to pick up her pace but Beedel could tell that she was struggling. She rummaged for something on her person. She found it and leaned her head down. Beedel couldn’t quite see what she was doing but he had an idea it involved snorting something. 
“I know this armour looks scary, but trust me I’m a nice guy.” Beedel was making up the distance quickly but he dared not run towards her. Once he was just out of reach he spoke once more. “I can get you to a hospit…” He trailed off and blinked for a moment. He was stunned by the fact that the woman had suddenly launched herself into a full sprint down the passing alley.
He turned to follow her but she was fast. Fast enough to make Beedel consider igniting his thrusters to keep up.
“You’re hurt!” Beedel called out.
Behind these buildings were narrow maze like alleys. Beedel began to feel suspicious and slowed his pace slightly to take in more detail of his surroundings.
The woman was slowing down. Beedel suspected she wouldn’t be able to keep up this pace. She turned another corner and then he saw the faint glow of a cast spell emanate from around the corner.
Beedel slowed down and drew one of his swords. He focused for just a moment and the Crystals within the sword reacted to his energy. The sword itself was but a mere skeleton of a blade. Once Beedel poured some energy into it a blade of pure light extended from the skeletal metallic base. The light fluctuated to Beedel’s focus, energy blades required strict discipline to use effectively.
Beedel rounded the corner ready for anything. But he was surprised to find nothing and nobody.  Still suspicious, he checked his rear for an incoming trap, nothing. He checked the sky, nothing. 
He sighed. “Guess she didn’t need any help.” He kept his sword drawn while he returned to the main street, still weary of a trap. Once he exited the alleys he deactivated his blade and returned it to his side.
An older man was watching nearby with wide eyes of interest and fear.
“Hello.” Beedel greeted.
The man seemed unsure and crossed the quiet street away from Beedel.
“Fucking city.” Beedel sighed.
He continued on his way home trying to convince himself that he should stop trying to help strangers. It made him think of Ren. He liked Ren a lot and in other circumstances he imagined they could be good friends.
It only took Beedel a few more minutes to get to his street. What he saw when he lifted his head concerned him greatly. He could make out at least two people snooping around his place. He was still a little ways off but he was pretty certain that’s what they were doing but he needed to know for sure before he could act.
Beedel strolled up confidently to his home and approached the closest person. At this distance Beedel could tell they were wizards. This wizard had their Crystal out and was scanning the area. Beedel seemed to catch her off guard.
“What are you doing?” He asked.
She jumped, startled. “Shit.” She twisted and raised her Crystal towards Beedel.
“Woah hold on.” Beedel raised both his hands palms out. Beedel could understand the shock and the fact that he was still wearing his power armour didn’t help the situation. 
The wizard’s Crystal was glowing, spell loaded, ready to fire off a shot, but she refused to make eye contact. After a moment of analysis the wizard lowered her Crystal. “This is official Wizard Association business. We believe there is a black mage in this house. It would be best if you moved along. Things might get ugly.”
Beedel took a moment to observe his home. He could see two more wizards cautiously looking into his windows and he guessed there might be more on the other side. These wizard squads tended to work in groups of 5.
“What will you do when you find the black mage?” Beedel asked while he analyzed possibilities. He could easily escape but he didn’t want any of his research data to fall into association hands.
“We will try to avoid a conflict but the mage must be subdued and brought in for questioning.” The wizard was starting to look impatient. “Please move along now.”
“How do you know he’s in there?” Beedel asked ignoring the wizards request.
While she replied she kept her eyes on her squad. “We’ve been tracking this one for a while. A spike earlier this evening was submitted improperly and it led us to this location.” She raised her arms gesturing to the whole surrounding area, “If we didn’t catch it, all of these people could have been in danger.”
Beedel thought of Ren. “What will happen to the wizard who missed this?”
The wizard looked suspiciously at Beedel. “There will be an evaluation. They will likely need to be terminated to protect the security of our city.”
Beedel didn’t like the way she pronounced terminated.
“Now please move along citizen.”
Beedel began walking down the road. He looked back the wizard had returned to watching her squad. “Oh just one more thing.” Beedel said cheerfully.
“I do not have time for this.” She replied.
Beedel ignored her once again. “You won’t find any black magic in there.”
The wizard looked confused for a moment. Beedel raised his arm up to access his wrist bound Crystal. He tapped it a few times as he hummed whimsically.
“How can you know that?” She demanded.
Beedel looked up and made eye contact. He could see that for the first time she’d noticed he was an Arborian. Arborians were rare in the city and Beedel knew that they were looking for him. Beedel also knew that these wizards would rather see him silently killed then brought in for questioning. This was the fourth time he’d been visited by a group of wizards like this, but this time he was prepared.
“Because this is my house.” Beedel smiled, his face plate lowered into place, and he tapped his Crystal once more. His house erupted in a contained blast of green fire. The shockwave nearly knocked him off his feet at this distance, even though he had braced himself. The wizard eyeing him was not so prepared and she was flung towards the road.
The other wizards had taken the brunt of the force, including the various bits of shrapnel and the scorching heat. He could barely make out the details with the bright green light but he could count at least three scorched corpses.
“Lucky!” Beedel smiled as he turned towards the wizard who’d been flung. She looked hurt but he wouldn’t take any chances with them, not anymore. 
She began to stand up. Beedel drew both his blades charging them with his inner energy. Once charged he did the same with his armour, activating the thrusters on the back.
The wizard now faced him. Confusion had left her, now there was purely anger. She lifted her Crystal and in that moment Beedel charged.
She blasted ray after ray towards him, but his speed was too much for her. He was within range to attack when she released a wave of energy that knocked him back.
She laughed as he tumbled backward. “I’m afraid you’ve brought a sword to a magic fight.”
“These aren’t just swords.” Beedel grinned. “Their customized.”
“Burn!” She charged for a moment fueling her magic with anger and launch a powerful ray towards Beedel. The stood bracing himself. With his swords crossed the energy from the blades flowed into a circular pattern and he used that to block the incoming ray.
The ray was deflected to a nearby building. People had started waking up to the commotion. Some had ventured outside but most looked from windows and relative safety.
“We better make this quick.” Beedel suggested.
The wizard did not reply and she charged him. Beedel lowered his shield and propelled himself into the air with lightning speed. The wizard shot at him from below and he continued to either dodge or deflect that attacks back to the ground. 
“Get down here coward!” The wizard screamed. “It is time to pay for your crimes against the association.” In a blink Beedel dropped to the ground right in front of the wizard. She smiled as she began charging another blastwave. “Got you.”
Beedel was swinging for her but just before she released the energy he poured his full power into his blade. It shield him from the blast and deflected most of it back to her, knocking the wizard back and she landed in the side of a car denting the metal around her.
She was about ready to get up and continue when Beedel was suddenly upon her with the tip of his blade touching her stomach. “Got you.” He ended it.
Crowds were beginning to form and Beedel knew he needed to flee before any more wizards showed up. They would be sending more powerful ones now.He looked back at his house the flames had died down and he was thankful that none of the other wizards had survived the blast.
Then he blasted off down the street at full speed. Once he was a good distance from the scene he slowed and found an alley to duck into. He’d take it slow from here, a couple of those blasts had damaged his armour. He checked it over, nothing serious, which was lucky. He’d gotten pretty good at fighting these low level wizards.
Beedel pulled up his Crystal and looked through it for a moment. Once he found the right contact he made a call.
“Yeah I’ll need to see Skeeter, is he there?” Beedel listened. “Good tell him to meet me in the tunnels. The usual spot.”

            <Title>Underground War</Title>
            <Text>Sirens pierced through Grummin’s dreamless sleep. He tried to sleep through it, he needed to sleep through it. But he couldn’t. The fighting hadn’t stopped for three whole days. It was hard to call it fighting, Grummin felt it was more like a slaughter. This was the only rest Grummin had gotten since the first wave of chimeras assaulted the Draconian undercity.  
	“Grummin, get off your ass.” Krozan’s voice was shrill. Grummin cared less and less to be around his uncle these days.
“I’m up.” Grummin replied, without moving from his cot.
“Your comrades are dying out there.” Krozan was never happy. “You should be out there helping them.”
“No one’s died.” Grummin replied. “These beasts are numerous, but we’re well fortified.” 
Grummin opened his eyes, Krozan was standing over him in full battle armour. His uncle’s green scales clashed with the black and red of the armour.
Grummin chuckled, “That looked better on Dad.” His father’s armour was one of the best around, some of the most advanced technology had gone into it. Several of the highest ranked wizards looked over it’s creation themselves. It was befitting the Lord of the wardens. But it didn’t sit quite so well on his uncle’s shoulders.
“I’m in no mood for your attitude.” Krozan snarled.
Grummin began sitting up, “Then I’ll just be getting back out there, and out of your way.” He began towards the chest nearby where he stored his gear.
“No you won’t be going back out there today.” Krozan’s eyes were fixed onto Grummin.
Grummin half ignored him and continued to rummage through the chest grabbing his armour. The gear was caked in dry blood, the shade nearly matched perfectly with his own armour. “Oh? Then where are you sending your prized fighter?”
“You’ll be on escort duty today.” Krozan couldn’t hide his smile.
“What?” Grummin stopped. “Escorting. Today? It’s not safe for down here for the wizards.” 
“Make it safe.” 
“This is just be the beginning, someone is creating these beasts, and they will create more. Bigger ones will come.” Grummin didn’t like the sound of himself pleading.
“And we will handle them.” Krozan replied. “Intelligence has located the source, they appear to be coming from the rats.”
Grummin was surprised, the Roden and the Draconians had a long troubled history, but such an attack would mean war in the tunnels and neither society wanted another war. 
“Don’t call them that.” Grummin replied, “The Roden can’t be behind this, they hate using magic.”
“They must hate us more.” Krozan began walking out of the room. “Get to your post on the West side of the Tower. Clear the area of any pests while you wait for further instructions.” With that Krozan left. 
Grummin tried to wrap his mind around the mess his Uncle was making of the wardens. Doing so only made Grummin think of his father and the pain that came with those thoughts. He quickly collected his things and donned his armour. The red armour suited his own red scales. Grummin opted for a torso-less set of power armour so he could remain quick and focus more power into his gauntlets. Once he had all his gear ready he began making way. 
The undercity of Novos was a catacomb of tunnels and civilizations. It was once a great dungeon of some long forgotten legendary evil. More recently it had been the home of thousands of types of creatures. They all lived violently. Furiously trying to carve out space for themselves and their kin. Then during Grummin’s father’s time, the High Wizards ordered the tunnels to become an official property of the Wizard Association. Bezelnorf Irontooth led the charge and become known as the Lord of the wardens. But he was gone now.
Grummin thought of his father daily. He always wanted to be like Bezelnorf. His father made peace with many of the creatures in the tunnels. The undercity spanned five times the radius of Novos, so peace pacts were made so that the center would be reserved for wizards and their business, and the other creatures could live freely in the outer areas. There was of course still resistance, but that’s why the wardens remain. To guard and guide travelers through the maze like passages.
Grummin walked solemnly through the tunnels. The sirens continued to blare, but he’d grown accustomed to them by now. With every step he felt the pain of leaving his comrades.
“They should fucking close the tunnel.” Grummin snarled. “We need everyone on the front line.” But he marched forward regardless of his words. Grummin could not disobey an order from his Lord, doing so would give Krozan all the reason he needed to strip Grummin of his rank and send him to the surface permanently.
Grummin’s steps became slower. He tried to focus on the task at hand, “Just guide some stupid wizard through the stupid tunnels and then I can get back.”
Grummin heard an explosion echo towards him from the direction of the frontline. He looked back, “To hell with this my brothers need me.” Grummin began sprinting back towards the frontline. 
After a minute or so of full sprint Grummin passed by a familiar corridor, it led to the officers’s conference room. Grummin just barely caught a glimpse of his uncle by the colour of his father’s armour. Those bright red power gauntlets always caught his eye.
Grummin slowed and then crept down the corridor towards the conference room. He listened first to the echos of their speech. He could hear his uncle talking with some of the other officers.
“What do you mean they aren’t in position yet?” Krozan was yelling.
“These chimeras are giving us more trouble than expected, sir.” One officer replied.
“They aren’t supposed to be that far out.” Another added to the conversation.
Grummin approached slowly. His curiosity peaked.
“Just got them in position.” Krozan commanded. “We can’t let any of these rats get wind of our men for this to work.”
A boisterous officer spoke up, “You need not worry sir. Our men are equipped with the latest stealth gear. They will not be caught. Sir.”
“That’s right damn it. These chimeras are more chaotic than we thought, but we are the Draconian wardens.” Krozan rallied. “We will show those dirty rats that there is no longer room for them in our tunnels.” Grummin was stunned at the officers’s cheer. “Kill them all!”
Grummin stumbled forward, barely catching himself from face planting into the rough ground. He began backtracking immediately. Once he reached the corridor he turned to run down the tunnel. He didn’t know where he was going, or what exactly he overheard but he was fairly certain hundreds of lives were at stake.
“Grummin?” The voice was familiar and refreshing.
“Petra.” Grummin didn’t know what to say. “I.. I’m.. uh.”
“I know Grummin.” Petra settled her hand on his neck. 
Grummin could only look into her eyes with utter confusion. “You do?”
“Yeah, escort duty.” Petra smiled. The blue scales around her eyes twinkled. “Especially right now. Krozan must still be pissed at you.”
Grummin had nearly forgotten about the escort mission. “Right, thanks for reminding me actually.”
“You’re such a slime brain.” Petra laughed. “But if you forget about this one Krozan will have you exiled.” Petra was smiling but her eyes were stern.
“But this is so much bigger than the escort, Petra.” Grummin began.
“I know.” She interrupted. “But go and get it done. Then come save us.” She rolled her eyes at him.
Grummin mulled it over. Petra gave him a moment and then interrupted his thoughts.
“There’s only one on schedule, and it’s a commision.” She reached out towards Grummin chin and lifted it so their eyes met. “Makes you wonder what the poor guy did to deserve it.”
Grummin laughed, “I don’t care if those bloody mages lose their magic.”
“I know. But the they do.”
“Okay.” Grummin paused, considering his next words, “but I need something from you.”
Petra raised her brow.
“Stall Krozan.”
She looked confused. “Why?”
“I can’t explain. But it’s important.” Grummin added.
“I don’t know if I can stall him much from the fight.”
“Just do something. Any little bit will help.”
Petra gave him a confused look and shook her head, “Why do I let you rope me into these things.”
“Because you love me.” Grummin winked.
“Shut up, ya jerk!” Petra swatted at him as she yelled.
Grummin didn’t waste any time and began moving towards the west tunnels.
Petra turned to watch him go. “Just for that I might not help you.”
“Thanks Pe!” Grummin yelled back at her. “I owe you one.”
“More like a million!”
As they separated their smiles faded. Thrust back into the present Grummin rushed forward as long as the Wizard wasn’t late he should be able to figure out what’s going on and stop Krozan if necessary.

            <Title>Intruding Conversation</Title>
            <Text>The kettle was boiling. Ren's hands trembled as he collected the mugs and poured the water into the cups. The aromas of the tea immediately put him at some ease. Beedel sat on the opposite side of the room watching Ren closely. 
Ren still had so many questions for his uninvited guest. The hostility between them had faded but the suspicion had not. Ren understood why Beedel would be suspicious. Beedel came expecting a fight against a fight and finding out an auditing wizard was looking into your affairs wasn’t much better. 
But there was something about Beedel, Ren felt quickly comfortable in his company. It could be the way he always seemed curious and attentive to your answers. Or maybe it was largely because Ren and Beedel shared a similar hobby. Metal craft and energy infusion were the basics to all sorts of hobbies, bullet crafting and armour modding among them. 
Neither had said a word since Ren started the tea. They both decided it would be best if they relax a bit before the questions begun. 
The teas were nearly done steeping. Ren asked again, “Milk? Sugar?”
“Lots of milk. No sugar.”
The room regained its silence. Ren brought over two cups of honey leaf tea, it was one of his favourites. It was very relaxing and Ren needed that here and now. This intruder turned house guest was about to enjoy a nice cup of tea with him. Ren wasn’t convinced he was safe just because this Arborian had left his power armour in the other room.
“Ren,” Beedel began speaking just as Ren found himself in an anxious mental spiral.  “I can tell you’re not a bad guy. Years of fighting will do that to you.”
“Do what?” Ren asked. 
“Give you an eye for character.” Beedel accepted the tea that was offered to him. Outside the ambient city sounds were like a sweet lullaby. They both sipped at their tea for a moment. Ren found it still quite hot, but Beedel didn’t seem to mind.
“I’m sorry about trashing your shop. I came here ready to for the fight of my life.” Beedel apologized.
“Don’t worry about it.” Ren replied. “This place has seen much worse.” With that Ren placed his tea down on the coffee table. Beedel sat in the couch and Ren sat across from him in a chair. Ren pulled his Crystal from out of his pocket. It began to glow a brilliant blue as Ren loaded a spell. 
The front door laid on the floor in several pieces. The light from Ren's Crystal streaked outward towards the pieces of the door. Once the jagged slow light connected with the pieces they began floating upward, reattaching themselves to the door frame and fusing back together. Ren left the two inner doors as they were for now.
Beedel eyes were lit in amazement, magic was common and Beedel used it himself, but the intricacy of Ren's spell was something only trained wizards could accomplish. It was wonderful to watch.
When the spell had finished Beedel gulped his tea quickly and then asked the first serious question, “Can I trust you, Ren?”
Ren had a sinking feeling. A feeling that he was headed down a road he didn’t want to travel, one that could change his life forever. Ren imagined it didn’t matter how he answered Beedel, his life had already begun to change. He could sense that much, their meeting had already shook a big rock loose in the fabric of fate and it was only a matter of time before that rock came tumbling down upon Ren's life.
Ren sighed lightly before taking a deep and centering breath. “Yes, you can. I’m not trying to fuck with you.” Beedel's gaze remained sturdy. “I’ve already wrote off the power surge from your house earlier and nobody else is going to come look into it.”
Beedel looked a little bit shocked. “I didn’t realize I had triggered a spike. But I do appreciate your discretion Renny.” 		
“Please don’t call me that.” Ren grimaced but Beedel hadn’t noticed.
“But why didn’t you make a report? And why were you snooping around outside my house?” Beedel’s questions were accusatory, but the high pitch of his voice made it difficult for Ren to take him seriously.
“My shift was just ending at the office, and since I lived nearby I thought I could get away without doing the report as long as I checked it out myself and made sure there was nothing strange going on. I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“Well mission failed Renny. You scared the grain right off me!” Ren found Beedel’s expressions almost cute, though he dared not say anything about it for fear of what that little bundle of cute could do with those two swords attached to his armour.
Beedel began another round of questioning, “But why were you able to avoid putting in a report. I thought the wizard association wassome sort of all seeing, well oiled machine.”
Ren understood Beedel’s confusion, Ren wasn’t really supposed to reveal information about his job or about how the whole system worked. The less the population knew the better in the eyes of the association. “Well you see Beedel, the association isn’t as well oiled as you might think.”
This caught Beedel’s attention. “Do you work in the tower?”
“No, but only one tier away.” Ren continued, “At my level, it’s really just a mess. The majority of the reports are false alarms. The ones that aren’t false usually have a reasonable explanation. The association just wants to scare the people into being cautious with their power usage. The do track everything, but it’s more of a macro overview of the whole city then specific scrutiny of individuals There’s just so much information to process and not enough wizards to do it well.”
Beedel appeared to understand, Ren thought so anyway. Ren's tea was now cool enough for him to drink. So he took a small sip. Beedel meanwhile was finishing off the cup. 
After good long exhale Beedel put his cup down on the side table. A moment passed as they examined each other. They weren’t exactly eye to eye because of the height difference, but Ren could feel the full weight of Beedel’s presence. 
He could tell Beedel had a strong will. If trained he could likely rise in the wizard ranks very quickly. But not only was it difficult to be accepted into the wizard association as a disciple without a reference, it was dominantly a human association. There were exceptions of course, but they were definitely rare and totally excluded from the highest ranks of wizardry.
Ren could tell that Beedel’s mind was racing. Calculating possibilities and determining what the best action should be in this situation. With a light in his eye, Beedel seemed to find it, the thought he’d been searching for and began to speak, “This makes a whole lot of sense Renny.” 
Ren scoffed at the name, but let it go for now. “What makes sense?”
“The missing piece of my research.” Beedel’s smile was immense. “Black magic, the wizard association, and this whole damn city. I’m closer now than ever to knowing the truth.”
“What truth? And what does it have to do with black magic?” Ren's fears were slowly creeping back into him. What was Beedel implying exactly, could there be black mages within the association? Surely not, that would compromise everything the wizard association stood for. 
“The experiments I mentioned,” Beedel hesitated. Ren nodded eager for Beedel to continue. “Well I was testing the energy usage of different tools and comparing that to the grid output, while cross referencing the power usage totals over the past 30 years.”
Ren had to interupt, “30 years? How old are you?”
Beedel seemed annoyed. Not by the question itself, but by the fact that this was the most important detail Ren saw in his explanation. “I’m 57 thank you very much. My species doesn’t age as quickly as yours. And when we do it is much more graceful.”
Ren shut up and consciously took a attentive stance to show he was ready to listen.
“So what I’ve found…” Beedel trailed off for a second. “I trust you Ren, but is this something you want to know? It isn’t something you’ll be able to unhear.”
Ren found himself feeling that sinking pressure again. This was the moment. He could say no and continue living his mundane life as an audit wizard. Maybe another 30 years or so working for the association and then a sweet retirement plan. All wizards got good retirement deals for their hard work and service no matter what level they achieved in the association.
Ren wrestled with himself going over the possibilities but fundamentally he was curious. Damn it, he was so frustratingly curious. A curiosity he had not felt for a long time. Ren wanted to be on the in, he wanted to know the secrets. Just because he knew Beedel’s secret truth didn’t mean he had to act on it nor did it mean the little guy was even telling the truth.
“I want to know.” Ren said after a few moments of thought.
“It doesn't add up.” Beedel thought that would be enough. But Ren's confused face told him he didn’t understand. So Beedel added, “All the power in the city, where does it come from?”
Ren's response was nearly automatic, “From the wizard association.” Beedel didn’t respond and only gave Ren a look a wanting more. So Ren continued, “And they get it from the grand wizards.”
“Right!” Beedel was getting excited, the kind of excitement that only comes from the anticipation when you’re revealing something mind blowing to a friend. “That is what they tell us.”
Ren was still lost, so he let Beedel continue.
“How many people live in Novos?” Beedel asked.
“In the whole city?” Ren inquired.
“Yeah, everywhere connected to the power.”
“Just over thirteen million at last count.” 
“What’s the average daily power usage per person?”
Ren thought for a moment, “It really depends on a lot of factors.”
“Gimme an average Renny.” Beedel interrupted.
“Okay, probably 7500 Arcs.”
“Right, now how much power output can a normal human charge in a day?”
“With some brief training most people can generate roughly 2000 Arcs, but it takes a toll on their bodies.” Ren was starting to see where this was going and stepped in, “But the Grand Wizards are different, they are trained to produce huge quantities of energy.”
“And you don’t question whether 7500 Arcs multiplied by 13 million people, is a little bit beyond the grasp of a couple dozen wizards?” Beedel had made his point. 
Ren had to go over the math in his head. Beedel continued before Ren finished his calculations, “That’s just under 100 billion Arcs. Ren that’s insane. Think about it.” Ren had never thought about it before, or crunched the numbers, this did seem ludicrous.
Ren was speechless, Beedel seemed unable to stop speaking, “Ren, you’re a wizard. You’ve been trained far beyond most people and you have an incredible amount of control over your magic. I just watched you expertly reassemble your home... sorry again.” Beedel smiled and shrugged. “But do you really think that these grand wizards are this much more powerful than you?” Beedel saw that Ren was beginning to understand, so he paused.
Ren took a deep breath, “In training all wizards learn about the grand wizards. They are on a whole other level. It’s solely due to their constant work that the city can survive the way it has.”
“Is it?” Beedel interrupted.
“Where else would the power be coming from?” 
Ren's tone hurt Beedel, but this was the question Beedel was waiting for. Beedel waited just a moment before answering, “I don’t know.” 
Ren sighed.
“But I have some theories.” Beedel continued, “They could be siphoning energy directly from people using some black magic, might guess would be that they are using an army of animated dead as batteries. Billions of them underground, hiding them in the tunnels.”
“That’s ridiculous.” Ren responded, “The association doesn’t use black magic.”
“That’s just one theory Renny.” Beedel was smiling, “But I know how to find out for sure. I think our meeting was more than just chance.”
“I asked you to stop calling me that.” Ren was getting frustrated.
Beedel ignored him and kept talking, “I need your help. You’re on the inside you could gather all the information we need.”
“Wait what exactly are you asking me to do?” Ren asked.
Beedel’s voice went heavy, it was the deepest Ren had heard it go since they met, there was some reassurance in this new tone. It gave off the impression of confidence, something Ren lacked in his life. A confident friend would be a welcome change to his anxious mind. “Ren, I need you to connect one of my tools to the central information hub.”
Ren felt like he was going to hurl. If he listened to Beedel, not only would he be putting his life in danger he might lose his job. “You’re asking me to spy on the association.” Even just saying it made Ren check over his shoulders. 
“It’s a simple gadget that can trace where the power if coming from. I’ve been trying to do this for years but I’ve never been close enough to the Wizard’s Tower. The further away I am, the greater the risk of being caught.”
Ren clued in, “So the power spike earlier?”
“Exactly, my latest attempt to determine the root of all this. If you could get this inside their system, it would barely register at all.” Beedel’s pitch rose with excitement.
Ren thought for a moment, “Even if you are right and the association is lying to us what are we supposed to do about it? What does it matter where the energy comes from? Haven’t they still been giving it away for...”
“Do you really believe you are free?” Beedel cut Ren off, it was the second time Ren had seen Beedel get angry. It was a powerful anger, driven by something in Beedel’s past. Ren could see that much, but he couldn’t see it all. “Look around you, I’m sure you’ve noticed the state of this city. It’s been crumbling. People are dying on the streets, criminals go unpunished while the authorities and the wealthy live plush fat lives.”
Ren tried to rebuttal, “Then what can we do about it?”
“We can bring it all to the ground. Destroy it all and start over.” Beedel’s voice went seriously deep again.
It was beginning to scare Ren, “That’s insane. Millions will die!”
“And millions will be freed. We’ve become comfortable Ren. This isn’t living, it’s waiting to die!”
They both stayed quiet for a short time. Beedel broke the silence, “I’m sorry Ren. I was attacked several times by wizards that I suspect were sent by the association. Each time I barely escaped with my life and I return to the forests for a while. Believe me when I say I wish I could give this up. Go home and be with my family. But I can’t, this is bigger than you or me.” 
Ren didn’t know what to say. Beedel took a breath and continued, “Just when I’m getting close to the truth is when they usually come. So, when my sensors saw you outside. I naturally assumed you were one of them, coming after me. Except I took the offensive this time.”
Ren just wanted to go to bed and then go to work tomorrow. He was tired and done with this conversation. “Well that’s all very well and good but I’ve got work in the morning.” The smile faded from Beedel’s face as Ren spoke. “So if you’ll excuse me, I’d like you to leave.”
“Will you help me?” Beedel pleaded.
“I’m too tired to think about this right now.” Ren replied. “Maybe we can talk tomorrow.”
“Very well Ren. You know where I live so if you need anything or if you’re in danger. Come to me.” Beedel silently got up and began towards the far room where his power armour stood motionless. 
Ren began cleaning up. Beedel walked slowly towards the far room but once he was sure Ren no longer had line of sight on him he sped up.
Once he arrived at his armour he whispered, “BugBot wake up.” BugBot emerged from a port within the armour and greeted his creator.
“Shh, no time. It’s time to start the mission.” BugBot snapped to attention. “Find a way to follow and keep an eye on Renny.” Beedel looked back down the doorways to see if Ren was heading his way. He wasn’t. “Transmit any data you can find. I’m counting on you.”
BugBot saluted and climbed down to the ground. The robot quickly found it’s way into a dark corner of the room and waited silently.
Beedel smiled and then he scurried up into the armour and once his limbs connected to the magical arrays the armour began to close up around him. Everything but the faceplate.
Beedel re-entered the front room of Ren's shop without much more delay. Ren had forgotten how threatening Beedel had been inside the armour. His true form was cute and trustworthy. Ren felt he had been fooled into listening to these absurd stories. The intruder who wanted to save the world. Ren chuckled. Beedel heard him, but made no show of it. 
As Beedel walked pass Ren he spoke, “Sorry again about your doors.” 
“It’s not a big deal.” Ren replied without making eye contact.
Beedel looked over his shoulder at Ren. He simply smiled. “Be seeing you, Renny.” And then he walked out of the workshop door. Taking extra slow care to open the door without breaking it. 
Ren really hoped he wouldn’t be seeing Beedel again, but something in him told him otherwise. Ren didn’t get around to fixing the doors before getting to bed. He was exhausted and hadn’t had much social contact in a while. Something so drastic had kicked the crap out of him. 
He very quickly collapsed onto his couch without pulling out the bed. He lay there for a while, thinking about the events that had just passed. As more time put itself between then and now, Ren felt more and more relieved. Perhaps it was all a misunderstanding. Or maybe he was dreaming. He could have fallen asleep at the workbench again. 
Sleep sounded like a great idea. Any fears of losing sleep were quickly forgotten as Ren began to drift into the night’s embrace. Pleasant dreams filled this sleep. Dreams of his mother and father.
Ren would have been smart to check around the rooms, to make sure everything was in order. If Ren had looked around his workshop, he might have noticed the little wooden automaton scuttling around. It found it’s way into Ren's bag and then made itself quiet. Waiting for the right opportunity.

            <Title>Final Stop</Title>
            <Text>The night was perfect. Everything going exactly to plan. Umbra was on her way to the light train station. It operated at all hours, but was seldom used during the night in this part of town. She made it there fairly quickly. She figured she could take the roof tops and skip the zigzagging of the streets with a bit of athletics. Plus she wanted to test out her new tools. The ring gave her an uncanny dexterity and combined with her improved sense from the Dust, she was all but flying across the cityscape. 
Most of the buildings around this side of town were low to ground, so even if she did fall the risk of injury was low. She laughed, thinking that if she fell she’d probably make the landing anyway. As she leapt towards the light train station she took in the beauty of her city. She’d grown up here, she’d trained here. She had broken into many of these places. Although the rule was she was never suppose to take anything. Her training was dominantly to teach her how to enter somewhere and leave without a trace. Leaving no traces was the key to being a successful thief. And a thief is exactly what Chloe wanted to be, and what Umbra was.
Tonight was the night of her first legitimate heist after all. The goal was an estate in uptown Novos. Her grandmother’s estate to be exact. It was the perfect spot for her first real heist. She knew the area intimately, she knew where they kept the valuables, she even knew many of the guards schedules and habits.
She was approaching the light train now. It was easily the tallest structure in this district. The train lines ran all across Novos reaching every district of the city and beyond into neighboring cities too. 
The station itself was nearly 50 meters up. The rail lines coming out of it were encased in huge tubes full of fluorescent light. The light shifted and morphed slowly. Creating the impressions of a gelatinous filling. 
Every few minutes or so Umbra made note of the small spherical capsules that made their way into or out of the terminal. The ones shooting outward were much faster than the ones coming in. She didn’t know too much about how the light train worked as her parents refrained from using it instead opting for the much slower coach wagons. Umbra chuckled, thinking of how her parents were stuck in the stone age. 
Umbra reached the station but she still needed to get down to street level to access the door.  She thought for a moment, analyzing the structure of the station, “I wonder…” Her gaze shifted erratically until she found it. “Perfect, an open window.”
She backed up a few steps on the roof and got a running start. Her leap surprised herself as she cleared the distance with ease. Umbra grabbed hold of the building and began climbing without hesitation. The architecture was suitable for climbing, but it was her confidence that made it easy. Chloe would have been the kind of girl to gingerly lower herself down from a meter tall ledge, Umbra, evidently, would leap from rooftop to rooftop. She’d changed so much in the past year. 
Umbra reached the top of the building and hopped into the window. She took a moment to look around for any witnesses, but the terminal was mostly empty. The only one around was the ticket clerk who wasn’t quite aware of her surroundings. 
Umbra walked over to the ticket counter. A young lady was working the counter. “One for Uptown Plaza.” She placed the money on the counter, exact change.
The young lady, was startled by the sudden appearance of a customer. Most customers at this hour were in bound and thus didn’t need to interact with her.
The clerk responded, “Ticket for where?””
“Uptown Plaza.” Umbra spoke as politely as she could and pushed the change closer toward her on the counter. The clerk fumbled with it for a moment and nearly dropped it. After a few moments of checking her monitors the clerk told her, “Please board capsule 216 and await further instruction.”
“Thank you.” Umbra said. She grabbed her ticket and went on her way. There was no one waiting in line which was good. But she still had to wait for the incoming arrival before she could board. Dozens of bright monitors made that very clear. They also said it wouldn’t be long now.
One side of the loading bay contained all the capsules. There were different sizes. Singles, doubles, family sized, and cargo. Number 216 was near the front and it was a double. Chloe looked around but didn’t see anyone else waiting. She thought it strange. 
All the capsules except the cargo ones, contained seats. The outside shells were made of a special coloured glass. One half was blue the other half was red. There was also a faint white strip around the circumference dividing the two colours. That strip is where the latches  and air holes were.
The middle of the bay contained the giant metallic arms that stretched and moved around to organize and prepare the capsules. Currently all four arms were almost motionless, kind of dangling, almost as if asleep. Their shoulders were connected to the ground and their elbows pointed directly upward. Each finger was the size of a large person and the arms were very muscular. They were all completely silver, made out of some kind of steel and imbued with powerful magic. They seemed to have a life of their own. Sometimes they would juggle together, other times they would play games with each other, high five, thumb wars, things like that.  
The other side of the small bay housed the large glowing tube. Up close it was mesmerizing. Almost like piece of art. Constantly changing so you could stare for hours. It was about four meters in diameter, most of the capsules were at least two meters in diameter. There was no room for more than one capsule at a time but thankfully the trips were very fast. So wait times weren’t usually long. 
This bay also housed a junction box. It was a large black box with no notable features except for the three large glowing tubes sticking into it. The junction box is what created the forces necessary to propel and attract the capsules.
Just then a voice came on the speaker, “Incoming. Please stand clear of the arms.” The arm closest to Umbra began to move. It stretched itself out a little bit, then shook it’s fingers awake. The hand opened a latch on the large tube and stuck itself inside with it’s palm open outward, waiting to catch the incoming capsule. The arrival was fairly slow, not much faster than a wagon. Jak had once explained that the capsules moved the quickest when they were leaving and they slowed as they approached their destination due to the pressure forces at play within the tube interacting with the capsules.
The man inside this single capsule was suited, and totally calm. Probably returning from some business meeting in the city center. The arm pulled him out slowly from the tube. Then with a flick of the wrist it tossed the capsule across the terminal towards another arm, which then passed it along to the next. The arms were all perfectly in sync and caught the capsule perfectly. 
As it flew through the air the capsule rotated but the chair and man inside did not. The man was as calm as ever. Barely even noticing the goings on around him. His face was glued to his Crystal. 
The voice came back over the speaker, “Now boarding for Uptown Plaza, capsule 216.” The big arm reached over and grabbed the capsule. Brought it towards Umbra and unlocked it. The glass lids popped open and Umbra climbed in. She fastened her belt and the arm closed the lids. Then he picked her up and moved her towards the tube. Chloe hadn’t ever used the train system and normally she’d be nervous. Umbra however was not nervous, in fact she was excited. Overflowing with energy.
The arm slowly placed the capsule into the tube, making very sure to keep it stable with the blue side pointed towards Novos. The inside of the tube was magical, visually speaking. From this perspective you could actually see the lines of light that made up the rails. Looking directly forward looked like a surreal painting that she would fall into as soon as the arm released her. 
The arm was slowly adjusting it’s grip when the voice on the speaker returned, “Capsule 216 to Uptown Plaza ready for departure.” The hand began rotating the capsule so the red side would be facing outward. Her chair remained pointed forward during the rotation. 
Almost immediately Umbra could feel the pressure begin to push the capsule outbound. The pressure was strong, but the hand’s grip was stronger, and the capsule’s structure, she hoped, was strongest.
Once the capsule was fully rotated the pressure was almost painful. Once again the voice on the speaker, “Ready… Release.” And she was gone. 
There was barely anytime to even think before she was already well on her way. The ride was incredibly fast, but in no way was it rough. Umbra thought she could get used to this. She tried to remember how long they said it would take and guessed no more than a few minutes at this pace.
She gazed towards the city lights, at this time of night that had such a beauty. Novos expanded so far into every direction, but far to the east Umbra could now see the Dying Woods by the sea side. It’s borders pushed up directly against the city. The treaty with the Arborians had prohibited any more removal of forest land. Umbra had never met an Arborian as most of them lived in the woods, but wondered if she might one day, her new life held so many possibilities.

            <Title>Late Night Visitor</Title>
            <Text>Ren was sitting in his workshop tinkering on his latest project. Bulletsmithing was an long forgotten craft that had been passed down to Ren from his father. The workshop was out back behind his house. Ren owned them both since his mother’s passing and his father’s disappearance. 
The house itself was modest, one of the smallest on the street. What made the property valuable was the workshop. It was almost as big as the house. Ren remembers many nights spent watching his father work his craft. Ren learned a lot just by observation. Even more when his father finally agreed to teach him.
Ren smacked his cheeks in unison to jolt himself awake. It would be another long night. His latest design was giving him some trouble and he had a hard time resting when his mind was fluttered with ideas. Ren held his tools and observed the bullet through a magnifying lens. A nearby monitor was connected to his Crystal and it displayed some plans that Ren had previously drafted. It’s glow and the light from a small spot lamp where Ren worked were the only sources of light in the room. Ren began to slowly etch runes into the bullet. He would then need to fill these runes with liquidized Crystal, but he needed to focus on the etching first, any small mistake would mean wasted materials and time.
The shop was set up into three separate rooms. The first was mostly for storing supplies, metals, gunpowder, magical components. Ren had also turned it somewhat into this living space. There was a bed in one corner and a small kitchen in another. He rarely went into the house anymore if he could avoid it.
The second room was the forge. Real hot, all the time. Shelving along every wall, filled with more supplies. The forge was set up right in the middle of the room. Large exhaust shoots leading up through the ceiling. Ren tried his hand at forging knives, swords and other tools with some success. But in his line of work these mundane blades were considered no better than a butter knife. At least his bullets could pack a punch if need be.
Any audit that turned violent would need to be resolved with with magic. Everyone and their grandmothers had a Crystal these days and auditors had to be prepared to fight off all kinds of spells. Although generally the low level wizards like Ren never had to go into any real danger. That was reserved for the higher ups, another reason Ren didn’t mind staying away from the Tower.
The night went on and Ren continued to work, he scrapped a couple bullets but his success rate for etchings was over fifty percent. Ren's work desk was a large U shape that covered all three doorless walls. The room itself was rather large, but it appeared smaller due to the clutter. Ren hadn’t kept things very organized, but he knew where most things were. That or they’d turn up eventually.
Bulletcraft was Ren's true passion. Nothing else in this life made him feel alive. When he got into that special zone of focus, he could work for hours without even realizing that time was passing at all. To observe him in this state was akin to watching the waves hitting the beach, or the clouds rolling over the sky. He was totally immersed into the universe, in a trance like state. He loved it, he lived for it. Testing out the bullets at a range was fun, he’d even sold a few off once or twice, but for Ren nothing compared to the craft.
Ren found peace in simply making the bullets, infusing them with magical properties, using his creativity to design new and powerful bullets. He could create bullets that bounced off surfaces, or bullets that exploded on impact. Some bullets could turn round corners, others could disappear only to show up later behind the target. Some of Ren's favorite bullets were his elementals. The ice one in particular tickled his fancy. 
The materials were rare, he found himself searching dark shops, and interacting with questionable characters just to get leads. Ren may have been cowardly when it came to auditing, but his courage shined when he was looking for new components. He used old alchemical texts for inspiration, witches’ journals, hermit scrolls, you name it. Ren could extract formulas and ingredients from various spells and potions to create nearly any kind of effect he imagined. He was surely talented, his father had told him many times, and Ren's results confirmed it now.
However despite all his talent and experience, he could never recreate the greatest bullet of all; The Golden Bullet. 
Ren was told that these were legendary magic bullets created long ago and that he should protect them at all costs. The Golden Bullets were famous in the bullet crafting world and to an extent a portion of the general population too as myth or legend. Wars had once been fought to obtain a single one, and now Ren supposedly had three. His father had left them behind when he disappeared. He hadn't decided if he believed that these were the real deal or not, but years have passed since then and he has yet to test even one of the bullets. He didn’t know what they did, just that they were supposedly world changing.
It was a quiet night, the cries of the city had already begun to lessen into slumber. Ren was rolling one of the Golden Bullets between his fingers, contemplating new ideas. Sketches and notes littered the table in front of him. He was lost in the zone of focus, staring at everything and nothing all at once.
Suddenly there was a knock on the door at the far side of the workshop. Ren wasn’t entirely sure he had actually heard any knocking at all or if the drowsiness was playing tricks on him. Ren wasn't expecting company, he never expected company, especially not at this hour. He hadn't even considered getting out of his chair yet, when he heard a terrible sound of a smashing of a door, his door. Ren's eyes widened and sprung into action, that door was still two rooms over, he had time.
He fumbled for some of the bullets lying around his work table. He could hear heavy footsteps, they shook the whole workshop with every step. Ren found the bullets he wanted very quickly, but not his gun. He would have cursed his lack of organization but the sound of a second door bursting open made him lose that train of thought, and regain focus on the present danger.
Ren's fear immediately rose and he remembered that the inner door hadn’t been locked. “The bastard didn’t even check!” 
Just then Ren noticed his gun belt hanging off the side of the work table. He leaped toward it, tumbling to the floor. He grabbed his gun out of the belt, then popped the revolving cylinder open. It had three slots and Ren's hands nervously began loading in bullets. He dropped several in the process, but managed to get two in fairly quickly.
He could hear those powerful footsteps, approaching methodically. The steps sounded metallic against his concrete floors. They stopped right before the final door. 
Ren noticed he still had the Golden Bullet in hand. A thought came to his mind that this may be his last chance to find out if these things were real or not. He loaded the Golden Bullet into the final chamber and rotated it to be his first shot. When he flipped the cylinder closed, he suddenly became calm. 
He felt powerful, could it be the Golden Bullet or maybe just the adrenaline rush kicking in. Ren didn’t have time to decide. Ren lifted his arm towards the doorway, he was still on his ass in the corner of the room but he was ready for whatever might come through. There was a moment of silence. In the distance he could hear the train zooming by. The door knob jittered.
“So now he tries the door.” Ren scoffed and then he cocked his gun, ready to see what the Golden Bullet had to offer.
Ren wasn’t too shocked when a hulking suit of armour came bursting through the door. At first Ren wasn’t exactly sure what he was looking at. It looked like some power armour he’d seen before but it was heavily modified. The intruder had two swords at his side. Although both the armour and the swords were of a modern design, Ren still appreciated the craftsmanship.
Ren's attention snapped to the present when he realized that he had spent too much time gawking at the craftsmanship, he shouldn’t have given the intruder so much time to act. He stabilized his hand and aimed his gun at the intruder's chest. 
The intruder however seemed to be frustrated. Ren cocked his eyebrow trying to understand what he was seeing. The suit of armour, and the intruder inside it, was stomping its feet and shaking its fists, one of which was still holding the door knob. The door had been shattered and the pieces lay on the floor, but it looked as though that wasn’t the intruder’s intention. 
The armour was nearly two meters tall and covered the entirety of the intruder’s body. But these newer models still allowed for the optimum mixture of mobility and defense. The adrenaline was still pumping hard in Ren's brain. He could barely think and he couldn’t stop himself from standing up and shouting, “Get the fuck out of here! I’m warning you.” Ren's gaze was strong, but his hands were weak. The armour stopped mid stomp and turned slowly to face him. One arm began moving up towards the intruder’s head. 
Ren yelled another warning, “I said stop!”
The hand continued calmly upward and then tapped a button at the side of the helmet. The face plate lifted upward, collapsing and then resting on top of the intruder’s head. The face inside spoke to Ren calmly with a dry and high pitched voice.
“No, you told me to leave, not to stop.” It was the voice of an Arborian. His short green foliage-like hair would have given it away if the bark-like skin hadn’t already. Ren hadn’t interacted with many Arborians. On the rare occasion that he did see one they always seemed to be so reserved, not unlike everyone else in this city Ren supposed.
“Umm, yeah... I guess.” Ren's confidence was fading quickly and he lowered his gun. He was still ready to use it, but somehow the tension had faded. 
The invading Arborian looked at a monitor attached to his arm and spoke once more, “There’s no black magic.” He seemed genuinely surprised. Arborians had a hard time being anything other than genuine. “But that doesn’t mean we are in the clear.”
Ren suddenly remembered that this was still an intruder situation and pulled his gun upward again. “Why are in my shop?”
The Arborian stopped looking around for a moment and seemed to notice Ren and the gun pointed at him for the first time. His eyes lit up with excitement. “Woah man, does that thing shoot bullets? Classic!”
Ren was lost for a few moments. He steadied his aim with his free hand and regained his resolve.
The Arborian raised an eyebrow. “You don’t think that a simple metal slug can penetrate this armour do you? Do you know how power armour works? It’s more than just metal, it’s infused with the arcane. It’ll stop any simple projectile.”
Ren cracked a smile, the Golden Bullet was no simple projectile. But if they weren’t real he’d be in big trouble. His magic bullets could do some damage to modern power armour, but rotating the cylinder now would make him give up his advantage. Failing to kill this guy would only make him mad. 
Ren's mind wandered for a moment when he realized this must have been the tallest Arborian ever, usually they don’t get far above a meter at tallest. He didn’t dwell on it, and tightened his trigger finger. “I don’t want any trouble, if you leave now we can forget all about this.” He was hoping he still looked at least somewhat threatening.
“I’ll be asking the questions here, sir!” The Arborian really exaggerated the last word and it hit at Ren's funny bone. Something about the voice’s pitch rising even higher. “Now tell me what you’ve been up to, sneaking around my property, being all suspicious like.”
Ren quickly realized just how mistaken he had been earlier. It wasn’t a green mage that lived in that house, but a craftsman like himself.
“Oh geez, man. I’m sorry, I’m actually an auditor. I was checking out a power spike at your place on my way home from work. I assumed you were just a green mage from the tree out front.”
“Oh, you liked the tree? Some of my finest work, it’s actually a guardian.” The Arborian had dropped most of his caution and the armour started to whir and buzz. Bolts spun, plates shifted and the whole chest cavity began to open up revealing a normal sized Arborian inside an over sized suit of armour. 
The magical arrays surrounding the intruder’s arms and legs inside the armour vanished as he hopped out of his seat. A little step ladder ejected from the waist to the ground, serving to prop the power armour. Presumably he was supposed to use the little ladder but his agility was far beyond that.
Ren questioned, “Wait that tree is a fake? It looked so real.”
The Arborian responded, “You haven’t been around many trees I take it? It’s actually somewhat based off of real genetic material and created as an exoskeleton for my sensory equipment to keep it hidden and protected.”
Ren thought this was a genius idea, but had other questions. “I really wasn’t expecting to see an Arborian. Let alone one covered in power armour. Aren’t you forbidden from using our technology?”
“That’s a normal misconception. Most of my people follow the old ways and refuse this new magic. That’s why they all live out in the shitty woods.” Beedel replied as he looked around the shop in awe. “But I love the stuff.”
“I had no idea.” Ren commented.
The Arborian continued, “Most humans don’t know much about us, but uh, sorry about your doors. I thought you were trying to stop my research. I’m Beedel by the way, Beedel Circuitwood.”
Ren sighed some relief. “I can fix them later. Do you drink tea?”
Beedel was well on his way snooping around the workshop. Ren didn’t mind, his fatigue was setting in now that the adrenaline was fading. 
Beedel casually responded “Yes, Honey Leaf, if you have it.”
Beedel followed up with a compliment, “Your shop here is quite a wonder to behold.”
“Thank you, I spend most of my time in here now days.” Ren felt some pride to be complemented. “Is that a Phoenix MK4? But modded right?”
“Good eye, most don’t recognize it anymore.” Beedel responded as he continued looking around. “I’ve swapped out the thrusters from an old 67’ SunDevil.” 
“Shut up. That was my Dad’s favourite Armour.”
Beedel smiled, “The man has good taste.”
Ren felt prideful as he walked to the doorway. It had been so long since he’d thought about his father fondly. “Milk or sugar?” His hand instinctively reached for the knob that was now laying on the floor and then he paused, gazing at the knob on the floor.

            <Title>The Night Crowd</Title>
            <Text>The night air was that perfect mixture of cool and dry that made for the best outings. Umbra was adorned with all of her favorite gear and she was hungry for some action. Novos was her home and it was massive. It was as big as the next 10 largest cities combined. Her hometown was nestled near the rim of Novos, where land didn’t cost your firstborn’s soul. Still a good distance from the center, but with the light rail, travel didn’t take much time at all. 
Umbra was headed in the direction of the rail station. She’d already snuck passed all her families guard and scaled the outer walls. Every step of her journey increased her excitement. Her destination being the most exciting of all. 
But before that a quick stop. Umbra couldn’t leave without a stop to her favorite local tavern. Jak’s, as it was known by most, was a quaint little pub. She had been warned about places like these as a child. Among other useless jabber such as don’t talk to strangers. However for a young girl a tavern like Jak’s could be a dangerous place to stumble upon. Maidens went missing with far less effort.
Umbra walked briskly along the streets now, excited to see familiar faces. Jak’s wasn’t far from her current position and she felt she could almost hear the laughter from within. The crowds were out, heading to and from gatherings. Some of the wealthiest people lived in this area. She could make out a few faces, but none dared try to make out hers.
“Pardon me…” The man had knocked into her as he turned away from a shop eyes fixed on his Crystal in hand.
Umbra pushed forward without a word or a second look.
“Well then.” The man scoffed.
She smiled and muttered to herself, “That’s right, don’t mess with me.”
Finally she reached Jak’s. To Umbra, it was home. The first time she ran away from home she had gotten lost on the streets. Jak found her, but not before she’d been harassed and handled by a group of thugs. 
Jak had saved her and tended to her. Jak listened, as she cried her life story and once she was done he calmly and sternly told her, “No one but you, controls your destiny.”
Jak’s words stuck with her even now. Umbra confidently strode through the doors and towards the bar. Jak met her gaze as he slowly wiped a draft mug clean of any water spots.
“What’ll it be.” He asked from across the bar as she approached. Jak was wearing his white stained apron. His fiery red hair stood up, shaggy and unkempt. His matching beard had begun showing traces of grey, but it only made him more attractive. Umbra felt a familiar stirring in her lower regions. 
She was still under the effects of the Dust, and it was making all of her sensations more powerful. “One of the good stuff.” For a few moments there had been silence, there usually was whenever Umbra walked through the door. 
Jak didn’t break his gaze while replying, “That’ll be 3.50.”
“How ‘bout I pay you when I get back?” Umbra had the money, but this was all part of the game. Every syllable was exaggerated just the way she knew would get Jak’s blood moving.
Jak was in no way weak willed, but that just goes to show how well Umbra now knew how to get under his clothes. “And what if you don’t come back?” Jak was usually quite stoic, and to any outsider this would have seemed like a coy joke playing along with her game. But Umbra was sharp,  especially with the Dust’s enhancement, she saw his insecurity.
Umbra began, “Don’t you worry, I’ll be back before…” But she was interrupted.
“Umbra, where you off to?” His stench thickened the air, his voice was hoarse and dry from too much smoking. Thugg, was his name. Almost everyone in Jak’s had a nickname. Thugg unfortunately did not.
Thugg continued to assault her eardrums with his lack of volume control, “We’ll be missin’ you here, miss Umbra. Don’t leave us, we can change.” Thugg wasn’t relatively speaking a bad guy, just more than a little annoying and difficult to be around for anymore than a few seconds.
Umbra replied, “Thugg I’m just going on a little trip to the city, I’ll be back before you know it.”  She winked to Jak.
That seemed to work, although Jak added a quick addition for good measure, “Go upstairs and lay down Thugg, Free room tonight...” Jak shot a sly glance to Umbra, “Umbra’s treat.” Then Jak hit her with a full smile. It drove her near mad.
Thugg proceeded to wander off, “Have fun Umbra, bring us back a present from the city!” Slowly up the stairs he went. To most it might have seemed like an early night, but Thugg’s schedule worked a little differently, he was plenty drunk and much past his bedtime.
Umbra checked the time on the old wall clock. Almost time to go. She looked towards Jak as if to say, where’s my drink? Jak understood. By now they had a sort of telepathic connection. Always able to know what the other was thinking, finishing each other's’ sentences, that sort of thing. Jak poured her a shot of his homebrew. He kept it under the table, but in close reach. It was a fairly popular choice. Just another of Jak’s many talents. 
She took the glass and sipped it, with some haste. She learned to savour the good moments of her life. So she savoured it, knowing that her night was not without risk.
Jak asked,“Do you remember your training?” It wasn’t a condescending question, it was almost Jak’s catch phrase. What’ll it be, was actually his catch phrase, but this was a close second.
“Of course. I had a great teacher.” Umbra looked Jak up and down, she tipped her glass, smiled, and took another sip. 
“Good, you’ll need it. The spot is in the middle of the city, if things go south...” Jak paused thinking of the words he wanted to use.
Umbra interrupted,  “I know the spot well. I’ve got this.” Suddenly Fleabite stuck his little face out of her cleavage. The dustsprite smiled at his old friend. 
Jak returned the smile, “Looks cozy in there.”
“It is.” Umbra replied. Fleabite popped out and scanned the room. Jak waved him to his bowl. The tall glass bowl on the counter used to house a fish or two, but Fleabite has since taken it as his home. The water was gone but all the contents including a small toy castle remained. Fleabite floated along into his home and rushed into the castle.
“Good to see you too.” Jak laughed.
Umbra laughed too, “He’s in a mood a guess.” 
They both took a moment to drink in the chatter of the tavern.
“You remember your spells too?” Jak broke the silence.
“It’s not like you to be so nervous.” Umbra responded. 
Jak rolled his eyes, trying to look aloof.
“I know the place like the back of my hand and it’s not heavily guarded.” Umbra reassured him. Her confidence was sky high, playing Umbra always helped her feel so sure. The Dust was also helping.
“Good.” Jak smiled as another thought crossed his mind. Umbra could sense it on his face and she didn’t need the Dust to do it. She’d almost forgotten she had taken it. She was now so comfortable with the effects, which is exactly what worried Jak. Umbra didn’t understand why he was worried. She would describe it as being the most awake and sober she’s ever felt, how could that not be a good thing.She was completely aware of her surroundings. She knew, for example, that Thugg had retreated to a room, and was now snoring peacefully in bed. No one in the room could even scratch their nose without her knowing about it. This would help her tonight and many nights henceforth.
“I’m good Jak.” With her eyes she told Jak that she thought this was just wonderful. With her lips she told him what she wanted to do to him.
Jak had to admit her confidence was sexy. He truly loved her. Umbra didn’t know this yet, but they both felt it. Their relationship was still young. Jak had learned that being too eager could scare a girl off, especially a caged bird like Chloe, who longed for freedom. 
“Listen Chl… Umbra.” Jak caught himself before accidentally uttering her real name. None in the bar knew it. But the slip up distracted him from his previous thought.
They shared a gaze.
He continued, “Don’t get hurt.” It was tough for Jak not to say how he felt. But he was confident in her skill. The setup was also ideal. He relaxed a bit remembering all their planning.
“I know this will end well for us, Jak. Have a little faith. I’ll be back before you know it.”
“I know it.” Jak was all about the lame jokes. She liked that about him.
Umbra finished her drink, knowing she needed to hurry. She pulled her scarf up covering most of her face. Placed her glass down on the counter. She mouthed the words, I love you. Jak couldn’t see it, but in his heart he felt happy. He waved her out. 
The rest of the night was business as usual at Jak’s Place.

            <Title>Wood For Brains</Title>
            <Text>He finally did it, he had created his newest mobile tracking device. The small creature was mostly made of wood and powered by a Crystal at it’s core. The creature looked up into Beedel’s dark eyes. Beedel looked back at his creation. The bright red orb eye was the centerpiece of the bug shaped machine. Long legs spread out along the table, they began to twitch. 
“Easy now.” Beedel smiled. “You’re not quite ready to move around yet, I need to confirm that the startup process didn’t fry you.”
The creature shook its whole body in protest. Beedel laughed, his creations often had personalities of their own, that was the most unpredictable part of his craft. 
“Just one second.” Beedel gestured a single twiggy finger up in the air and jumped across the room. His workroom was spotless and masterfully organized. Beedel paused looking at his storage space and then opened a drawer. “No...” He continued looking. “Not here either.”
The automaton was beginning to stand while Beedel was away, taking in their first few moments of existence slowly and trying to process the world. Beedel opened a small hatch in his desk, “Yes that’s it.” He twisted back towards his newest friend.
His creation was standing, not elegantly, but standing nonetheless. The small container Beedel had pulled from the desk slipped through his wooden fingers and tumbled along the floor.
“How are you doing that already?” Beedel asked.
“...” The creature moved as if it was responding, but not a sound came out.
“Right.” Beedel knelt over and picked up the container he’d just dropped. It wasn’t dented, but Beedel felt a tinge of anxiety as he opened it, knowing the fragility of the contents.
“This was my grandfather’s.” Beedel pulled a small green Crystal out of the box. It was dulled from time, but had an inner brilliance to it. “I don’t know if it still works, or if it did before I dropped it.” 
Beedel walked over to his creation. The creature looked up at him, hopeful and bright eyed. “Let’s find out together.” 
Beedel gestured to his wooden friend with the Crystal in hand. The creature’s torso twisted around and opened up with the fluidity of any well oiled machine. But Beedel’s creation was far from any machine, these automatons could learn and grow. The creature leaned forward to meet the Crystal in Beedel’s hand. The small green Crystal fit perfectly as the creature accepted it into its being. It spun again in the reverse process and closed itself up.
“So?” Beedel asked. The creature looked up at him. “Can you speak?”
“...” The creature tried, but again nothing came out.
“Shit.” Beedel sat down in his chair next to the desk. He looked over to his creation and wondered if the Crystal was broken or if he had made a mistake. He reached toward the creature. “Alright then, let’s have it back.”
A shake of protest from the automaton.
“Fine.” Beedel retracted his grasp. “You can hold onto it. More importantly we’ll need to deal with our visitor from earlier.” Beedel got up and began stretching out his limbs. The automaton mimicked Beedel and began doing the same, now with a bit more stability in its movements. Beedel looked over and observed his creation. This one was moving around with much more efficiency every time he looked at it. A world a difference from his last attempts.
“You’ll need a name.” Beedel thought about it for a moment. “BugBot.”
BugBot gave him a wide eyed look. Beedel thought that was a yes.
“Good. I’ll need you tonight. Are you ready?”
“Eee” BugBot emitted some noise.
Beedel smiled. BugBot leapt from the table to his shoulder. Beedel was startled but he began to grow accustomed to BugBot’s rapid growth. He pulled on a book in a shelf near the only exit and one of the walls on the other end of the room began to slide away. The thud had startled BugBot, sending him reeling backward. BugBot tumbled to the floor but shook it off.
Once Beedel confirmed that BugBot was okay his attention returned to one of his most prized possessions. It waited for him in the darkness of the hidden room. The tall suit of armour was made mostly of metal, unlike most of Beedel’s creations. It needed to be, this power armour had all the latest arcane integration and even a couple of aftermarket mods. All that power coursing through the system would fry all but the highest quality woods, and being in the city didn’t give Beedel much selection of plant based materials.
The armour was twice as tall as him. When Beedel approached it in the darkness, it began to whir and glow. It recognized his soul-signature, as Beedel had designed it to. 
“Pretty cool, huh?” Beedel gloated.
“Eee. Eee.” BugBot agreed.
He tapped a trigger on the side of the torso and the armour began instantly shifting and moving in on itself. The torso completely opened up to reveal a cavity full of switches, monitors, and apparatuses. Then a small step ladder ejected itself from the waist of the armour and connected to the floor.
Beedel swiftly hopped into the familiar seat and strapped himself in. The ladder retracted and the chest plates began covering Beedel inside the suit. In a moment everything except his grainy face was covered by steel and technology. The suit began to whir louder still with him in it. The glow of energy from within began brightening as Beedel focused his own energies into the armour.
Beedel took a few breathes. “Alright. We can do this.”
BugBot looked up expectantly at Beedel.
“Don’t worry you’re coming too.” Beedel placed a few quick commands inside his armour and it responded by extending an arm down toward BugBot and pointed to it’s back with the other.
“C’mon up. Best seat in the house.” Beedel laughed.
BugBot obeyed his creator’s command but not before cautiously tapping at the metallic fist of the armour. Then he scurried his way up the arm and found is home directly behind the neck plate in Beedel’s back.
“It might be a little early but, we don’t have much time left.” Beedel said. “Your first mission…” Beedel paused, “Is to track the intruder from earlier. Can you do that?”
“Eee.” BugBot proclaimed.
“I need to fix your damn voice box.”

            <Title>Life Of The Party</Title>
            <Text>They all laughed. Even Chloe was laughing, but not on the inside and she suspected the same was true of her company. She excused herself, to the dismay of the duke’s son. His eyes had been all over her this evening. She wore some tight lacy dress that her mother had bought her. It itched and tugged at her. She just wanted to get it off and get away from this party.
The hall was immense and brightly lit with dozens of colours of light. They moved and danced along with the music and when Chloe finally emerged from the doorway she felt as if she could breathe once again. Although her breathing would be better once she removed this monstrosity of a dress. But the fresh air would suffice for now.
She looked back towards the party. Sighed some relief to be leaving and made note of all the fumes pouring out of every opening in the duke’s mansion. Mostly it was atmospheric fog for the occasion but Chloe wondered just how much of it was residual smoke from the whetgrass. She only rarely partook, it made her too quiet for these kinds of events.
Onward towards the gate she hailed a coach. It didn’t take long for a passing carriage to pull over for her. The whir of the floating vehicle made it hard to hear the driver, or maybe it was the blaring music of the party, regardless she climbed in. 
Once inside Chloe ripped at the buckles on her shoes. High heeled jeweled things. Uncomfortable. She looked up. There he was again, Sebastian, the duke’s son. Out in the courtyard looking for her, asking people if they’d seen her. The third group he asked pointed her way.
“Driver.” Chloe commanded. “Let’s move.” The coach begun to roll out into the night. Chloe pulled off her gloves and undid her hair.
“Uh. Miss?” The driver asked. “Where we going?” 
“The Rendal estate.” Chloe answered, awaiting his next question.
“Which one?”
“The big one.” Chloe sighed. “Some privacy?” She could see his eyes in the mirror.
“Right, Miss.” He said as he rolled up the privacy screen.
Chloe began removing her gown. Thankful to loosen her prison of clothing. The rest of her ride was quiet as she drifted through her thoughts. 
Chloe was snapped back into the present when she overheard Bernard’s voice.
“This is a private residence.” The butler spoke loudly.
Chloe gathered most of her clothes and opened the coach door.
The driver was in the middle of explaining himself when Bernard caught sight of her.
“Just pay the man Bernard.” Chloe smiled, as she exited the the coach she was barely wearing anything at all. The back of her dress was open revealing her scar among other things to the driver now behind her.
“Of course.” Bernard replied as he handed her his jacket and proceeded to pay the driver.
Chloe continued walking up the long path to her home. The path was lined with gold that glowed in the night, lighting her way. The path was long enough to give any guests time to revel at her family’s wealth. The Rendals were not known for their modesty.
Bernard caught up to her, “That wasn’t very smart Chloe.”
“He won’t say anything.” Chloe replied.
“Yes he will.”
“They won’t believe him.”
“Maybe not.”
“So what’s the problem.” She huffed away the frustration. The long walk home was precious time. Time in between her many roles as a Rendal, when she could be herself. “Sorry.”
Bernard smiled at her. “So how was the party?”
“Perfect as usual.” She replied. “Not a thing out of place.”
“And Sebastian?”
Chloe rolled her eyes.
“Right.” Bernard agreed. They’d finally reached the house, it was several stories tall and twice that wide. Secluded among many tall trees to not be seen from far. From within the clearing at the front of the house, it stood aloof to an expectant awe, Chloe had none for it, and it stood aloof to that as well.
“I can take the rest of it for you.” Bernard held out his hand.
Chloe wiggled her remaining clothes off under the housecoat and handed them to Bernard, “Burn them.”
“You mother paid good money for…”
“She has more money.” Chloe rebutted. “I’m going to read.”
“Shall I see you to your room?”
“I’ll be in the study.” Chloe smiled. “Long night ahead of me.”
“Call on me if you need anything.” Bernard spoke earnestly.
“I will. Thanks.” Chloe smiled and then found her way upstairs aiming to avoid her parents.
Later that night Chloe was sitting in the candlelight among many books, reading absently. She was in her favourite housecoat and sitting in her home’s study room. The study was a simple room with most of the walls covered by bookshelves. The fireplace in the corner wasn’t lit. The night was warm enough without the extra heat. Chloe felt a tug at the back of her hair.
“Just a second Fleabite.” Chloe responded. “I’m nearly done with this chapter, then we’ll  go.”
The dustsprite floated around to Chloe’s front side and smiled with its eyes. It had been months since Chloe and Fleabite started spending time together. Yet the little dustsprite was still a marvel to behold. Fleabite looked like nothing more than a floating ball of dust and soot with a pair a dark eyes. 
Chloe noticed the creaking out front of the door and shoved Fleabite under the table and held him there. The door was opened quickly, as if to catch someone in the middle of mischief. Bernard poked his mustached face into the study with a wide smirk, “Chloe dear, will you be needing any snacks this evening?”
Chloe’s eyes were wide trying to think of a response while trying to hold Fleabite under the table. “No Bernard, thank you though.” She said. “I’m about done here and I’ll be heading to bed soon.” 
“Very good.” Bernard replied, “Big day tomorrow, being well rested is just as important as being well learned.”
Chloe rolled her eyes and smiled. “Thank you.” 
“Goodnight.” Bernard said as he retreated slowly from the doorway. Then he added abruptly, “Oh, and Mr. and Mrs. Rendal have already retired to their chambers. In case you were curious.” He winked and then left.
Chloe chuckled and then let up on Fleabite. “Sorry buddy. Bernard is cool and all, but he’s still a little too loyal to my parents.”
Fleabite squeaked in protest.
“I know, but if all goes well tonight, we won’t ever have to come back here.” Chloe turned back to her textbook and finished reading the last few pages as Fleabite breezily floated around the room. 
Chloe’s studies kept most of her waking hours occupied. She was enrolled in the prestigious Aberfont Academy. All the women in her family had attended and graduated from the Academy, so of course she was also expected to continue this tradition. However the Aberfont didn’t teach anything practical in Chloe’s mind. The school focused on politics and history. They abhorred the notion of training one’s inner energy to use magic instead of relying on the grid system, but that didn’t stop Chloe from seeking out old tomes and learning a few tricks for herself. 
“Alright, let’s get a move on.” 
Fleabite squeaked with joy. Chloe nearly squeaked back with excitement but then centered herself in the moment. A few deep breathes, just as Jak had taught her. 
Chloe crept into the hall, and pulled out her Crystal. The perfect palm sized sphere of enchanted glass was for the most part colourless but as Chloe concentrated a purple luminescence was emitted from within the orb. 
She selected a spell and waited a moment for her Crystal to charge. It pulled the energy from within Chloe instead of using the power grid provided by the Wizard Association. She was taught that when using unsavory kinds of magic it was best to pull from her own energy pool rather than risk being detected by a auditor. She also found it fun to practice and got excited over her steady improvement. She could now cast spells previously too draining and maintain them for longer periods of time. 
Once this spell was fully loaded the luminescence of her Crystal peaked. The energy inside silently emerged from the Crystal and circled around her fingertips like slow moving lightning. It flowed up her arm and then all the way down to her feet. Encircling her totally for just a moment. 
Chloe loved to feel that energy surround her, it was like an ecstasy. The sounds all around her and specifically of her footsteps were suppressed as she walked down the hallway from the study to her bedroom. She return her Crystal to her pocket as she passed her parents quarters but the effects of the spell remained. 
Chloe could see the faint glow of torchlight through the door cracks. She was not concerned about them actually hearing her even without her magic. Her parents were often too engrossed in their own Crystals to notice each other. The magic was more for fun and practice. Chloe pushed away any thoughts of concern for her parents and she continued her run down the hallway. Fleabite followed her joyously bobbing as he went.
She reached her room and entered slowly. Checking back to make sure Bernard hadn’t been around watching her.  She released the energy from her magic and closed the door. Her bedroom was a fabricated image of the daughter she ought to be. The room itself was lush with pillows and girly things. She didn’t care at all for the decor, especially the arrangement of dolls that were set up in a display case as some form of shrine to her early years. She had never cared for the dolls as a child and now she found them downright creepy.
“Fleabite, would you mind?” Chloe asked.
Fleabite smiled and floated towards the far wall. Chloe followed him slowly, the tall window shed some wonderful moonlight into her room. It was a great tall window that stood much taller than her and nearly three times as wide. It had two frames in it that opened and several more that didn’t.The moon was full, that was not by chance. Tonight was a special night for Chloe.
Fleabite flew swiftly into a small crevice in the stone wall as he had done many times before. From inside the wall he navigated to that familiar space and began pushing. The little dustsprite had a disproportionate amount of strength for his size and weight. He began bashing his core against a specific brick repeatedly. Slowly Chloe could see it moving. Bit, by bit, by bit. Until it was far enough out that she could grasp the edges with her fingers and pull it out the rest of the way. 
Fleabite looked tired, but happy to be useful. Chloe patted him gently, “Thank you.” 
Chloe didn’t want to waste anymore time. She found herself accessing this hiding spot more and more lately. It was a small compartment, that was just big enough to house a set of clothes and a few tools. Chloe removed the clothes one article at a time. Everything was neatly folded and placed precisely to maximize the small space. Underneath the clothes lay a small metal tin. The tin had a simply design. It was flat black with a white inscription of her name. Inside the tin was a ring, a small bag of powder, three knives, and a set of tools in a small, well designed pouch.
Chloe removed her Crystal from her pocket and then removed her housecoat. Her pale skin was clear of any blemishes except for the large scar on her back. She picked up the protective undergarments first. These briefs were unlike those ridiculous lacy things that stretched and pushed her body into false shapes. These undergarments were sturdy and built for support. 
She reached for the leather pants next. They were designed for mobility of the highest order. Her mother would practically faint if she knew her daughter was out in public sporting anything but the most flowing of skirts or dresses. The undershirt was light and comfortable, the jacket was another work of leather, very fine quality. The light padding was useful in avoiding any bumps or bruises. She wouldn’t hear the end of it if she damaged herself, but that no longer mattered, she could be bruised and cut all she wanted now.
Chloe was the prize of the Rendal family, she wouldn’t simply be given to marry any prince that came along. She would be used as a bargaining chip to gain something from someone at some point. The duke’s son, Sebastian, was the most promising candidate, but Chloe hated him.
“How I’ve missed this leather.” Chloe reminisced. She felt as though whenever she wore these clothes it was as if she had shaken off the dust from a dull dream and awoken to the hard and fast reality of Umbra, her chosen name. Fleabite floated around the window looking out with excitement. “I’m almost ready.” Umbra reassured him. She knew Fleabite missed Jak. She missed him too.
Umbra was nearly fitted for her excursion. She wrapped a light scarf around her face just below the eyes, covering everything down to her neck. The scarf was a wonderful material that was easy to breathe through. She lifted her hood and tucked her long hair out of sight. 
She slipped the ring onto her middle finger. The ring got a little stuck on it’s way down her finger, but with a bit of effort it found its way. She felt instantly relaxed and limber. She was not exactly the most athletic girl growing up, since her parents didn’t care for her doing anything boyish. But this ring had the power to make her as limber as a veteran dancer. Useful for all the climbing, jumping, and running she expected to be doing tonight.
Umbra holstered her knives, and pocketed her tools. She then took the small bag of powder and opened it. It was foul smelling powder, the result of some witch’s stench not a quality of the product itself. The powder was a pale orange and very fine, almost dust like.
“I guess that’s why they call it Dust.” She noted. 
Umbra pulled down her scarf enough to reveal her mouth. She wetted her finger with the tip of her tongue and dabbed it into the powder. A tiny bit was all that was needed, she followed the instructions she’d been given to the letter. The substance would help her immensely but not without risks.
Umbra lifted the powdery finger to her mouth. She took a final glance around the room, making sure everything was in it’s place. She noticed her Crystal still sitting on her housecoat. She reached out with her free hand and slipped it into her tool pouch. 
Finally over towards the door, she listened for just a moment to reconfirm her parents’ lack of lucidity. No sounds. She would be fine. She licked the powder off of her finger, the taste was quite pleasant. She was surprised, especially considering the stench it gave off.
“Huh, orange.” Umbra laughed. But it didn’t take more than a few seconds after she spoke for the substance to kick in. At first it was frightening, as if all her senses were exploding with stimuli. The room was as without stimuli as she thought it could be, however Umbra’s senses were expanding, her awareness opening up to all the relative sensations available to her. The initial fear quickly left as she became accustomed to her new and improved senses.
Fleabite gave her a look of concern.
“I’m… okay.” Umbra was transfixed. This was her first time on Dust. The substance worked exactly as advertised. She could now clearly hear her father snoring in his bedroom down the hall. Her mother lay beside him with the light on, reading a book on her Crystal. Umbra could hear the tapping of her mother’s finger on the Crystal every few moments, she figured her mother was reading another fashion story, or some other literature with more visual information than language.
The dark corners that used to be in the room, seemed to vanish. Umbra was clearly able to see in the dark, she wondered how dark it would have to become for her to actually see nothing at all.
She could feel the air move around her, like little waves crashing onto the sands of her body. It was so obviously clear to her now that her room was full of drafts. The smallest of drafts that even the most skilled builders would miss, but she could clearly feel them. She could even pinpoint the locations of all the little cracks in the stone bricks. But the biggest draft of all came from her large bedroom window. 
As she looked towards the window she nearly became flooded with stimuli again. The view of the city had always been magnificent, but now it felt as though she could see farther and more than ever before. The one thing she loved about her bedroom was the stunning view, she would miss it, but she would be in the city from now on, instead of a prison looking upon it.
She moved to the window to see more clearly and a small tear dripped from her eye. She calmed her mind once again, using the techniques Jak had taught her. She wiped the tear away and opened the window. She looked down to the ground from the fourth floor. Her head was calm now, and she saw the familiar pathway down in a new light. 
Fleabite followed her outside and buzzed happily. 
Umbra sighed, “Freedom.” She smiled at Fleabite and stuffed the bag of powder into a pocket, making sure it was secure. This was a valuable tool, she could see that already. Umbra looked back into the dark room. Everything was so clear to her now. She turned away and began her journey to the ground.
Her new life was about to begin.

            <Title>Into The Woods</Title>
            <Text>The Great Woods was a good distance away from any major cities. Most civilized folk tended to stay far away from the Great Woods for fear of monsters and savages. They were right on both accounts. The trees were massive. Ren nearly went into shocked to see such natural beauty up close. If there was a path to follow into the woods Beedel didn’t seem to be following it. The BulletCar swerved in and out of the trees tagging a few along the way. Ren held onto the framework inside the BulletCar for dear life.
	A few clicks into the woods they came across a large wooden gate. The walls extending out of te gate were also wooden and extended well into the distance on either side of the gate. Ren was in awe of the architecture. The only thing kind of building he’d ever been exposed to were the modern ones in Novos, which were mostly made of concrete. 
Beedel stopped the BulletCar suddenly in front of the large gates. As he did many faces began popping up from the back behind the wooden pillars. Ren realized they were Arborians, it was quite obvious by the hues of their hair. Many of the small Arborians jumped down from their high perches and began opening the gate. Beedel still sitting in the driver seat began to eject from his power armour. Ren noticed that the extra height from the armour seemed necessary to operate the BulletCar.
The suit wrapped itself around the driver seat and Beedel stepped out. Before opening the door, Beedel turned to Ren, “Leave your stuff here.” Beedel spoke seriously, “It’ll be safe in the BulletCar. Grab the girl.”
Ren looked back, she looked on the verge of waking up, it was probably best to get her somewhere that looked less like the inside of a metal nightmare before she woke. Ren left his gun with all his bullets on the floor beneath his seat. But some clawing instinct in the back of his mind told him to hold onto the Golden Bullet. Maybe it was Greed, or a faint mistrust in this entirely new circumstance. Either way it was the most precious thing he had with him, without including all the emotional value.
Ren opened up the backside door on the BulletCar and carefully unbuckled Chloe. He didn’t want her to suddenly wake up and freak out. Ren was daydreaming that their first interaction would be much more like a fairy tale. As Ren removed Chloe from the seat he occasionally looked over to Beedel and the growing crowd of Arborians.
Beedel seemed to be treated as if he was a powerful and feared relative. They treated him with a cold respect while at the same time looking genuinely happy to see him. Beedel greeted many of them with a firm handshake and there was a few who merited a good hug. 
The first interesting thing Ren noted about the Arborians was that their clothes were very plain and as far as Ren could tell they carried very little technology with them. Many had knives and other weapons, but they were all of the ordinary sort instead of the modern power versions. Beedel wondered how they survived in the woods with such primitive tools. He even took note of a few archers up on the walls, they used sticks and stones for their arrows. Ren did admit that every tool he saw was expertly crafted with fine details that gave them a very valuable quality, in a antique family heirloom sort of way.
Beedel was now pointing in Ren's direction. Ren had Chloe in his arms and was beginning to head their way. He couldn’t quite hear what Beedel was saying but as soon as he was done saying it three of the Arborians ran towards Ren. Everything happened so quickly and with very few words. But two of the Arborians had taken the woman from Ren and were on their way bringing her inside the fort.
Ren was being ushered quite urgently towards Beedel. Once Beedel was within ear shot, Ren called out to him, “What’s happening?” The Arborians tugging on Ren's arm hadn’t stopped and was pulling aggressively now to get Ren moving.
Beedel replied in a casual tone, “Just roll with it. We are honoured guests.” Beedel let out a solid laugh, which would have given Ren confidence if the Arborians around Beedel weren’t in the middle of searching his person.
The young Arborians tugging on Ren's arm was moving at such quick rate. Ren barely had any time to be in awe of the inside of the fort. Nearly everything was made of wood. The only things not wooden that Ren could see were the ropes that tied the wooden things together. Even those, Ren reconned, were made from some kind of plant fibers. The structures were quite a sight. Tall spiraling staircases and suspension bridges everywhere you looked. Ropes were stretched tightly overhead connecting various rooftops together. Ren temporarily wondered what these ropes were for, until he saw one or two Arborians using them like ziplines to quickly move from place to place.
The people inside the fort were a busy folk. Many stopped to get a good look at the outsider now entering their home. But they quickly returned to their tasks without a second glance. Ren had so many questions but when he tried to inquire the answers from his usher, he got little more than a few grunts and a couple words of Arborians.
Ren decided his tour guide was lacking in languages skills and returned to trying to get as much information as he could from observation. Quickly they were approaching one of the larger trees inside the fort. It had been hollowed out and now looked like a home big enough for at least a dozen humans. Ren try to calculate the exchange rate from humans to Arborians, but was interrupted when he realized they were about to enter this tree house.
Ren looked back and saw that Beedel too was now entering the fort. However Beedel was being stopped by almost every passing Arborians. Some Arborians even climbed down from higher levels and come and greet him. Beedel sure was popular, Ren thought to himself.
The inside of the treehouse glowed a warm orange glow. Ren quickly noticed it was a glow of candlelight but rather some luminescent plants. Ren thought this to be a great substitution for open flames, especially when your home was a carved out tree. To Ren's surprise there were very few people in the treehouse. Ren only counted two Arborians excluding the one that brought him in. But he saw that the floors went quite high up into the tree and there could be others lounging on the higher levels. Many of the walls covering the interior of the tree were filled with bookshelves filled with books. 
There was a middle aged woman sitting to one side of the room reading a hefty tome. She glanced up and met Ren's gaze as they entered the room, but she immediately returned to her reading without a word. The other Arborians was an older man who was fast asleep in a large chair that looked more like a bowl in stilts than a chair. Most of his hair had migrated to the lower part of his face except for a few straggling strands. All of his hair was very grey, nearly white, and it fluttered wistfully in the air was his snores rang through the hollow tree like a heartbeat.
The woman had clearly reach a proper finishing point in her reading and closed the book with a gentle force. She spoke quickly in between the loud snores. It was in the Arborians tongue and Ren's never quite been the cunning linguist. He did however catch a detail in his companion’s reply. It was the name of his father, Silver Magic. Clearly there was no direct translation for such a name, it sounded out of place in the series of syllables that came before and after it. This only exaggerated the intensity of the utterance.
The name had gotten the attention of the Arborians woman. Her large ears perked up quite a bit and she nodded in understanding. She slowly moved to the side of the sleeping elder and gently grazed his arm in an attempt to wake him peacefully. This attempt was for nought as he sat up suddenly as if some alarm signalling the end of time had just rung. She was able to calm him quickly enough and he regained a sense of presence. She spoke a little in his ear and pointed towards Ren.
As soon as the man’s eyes made contact with Ren's they were locked. The exchange was intense for both of the men. Ren felt the overwhelming history behind the man’s eyes. Ren knew Arborians could live for much longer than the average human, and by the look of this man’s eyes all those long years had been full of life, hardships and victories alike. The man was reading Ren's life as well. But in a different way. The elder was reading Ren's potential, all the life in his eyes that has yet to come. Only those who’ve lived a long life to the fullest can measure a person’s true potential in this way.
The silence was broken when the elder Arborians cleared his throat to speak, “Welcome. I am Solphas.”
Ren took the pause as a hint to introduce himself, “I’m Ren sir. Ren Magic.”
Solphas’s eyes narrowed in interested, “Then you are indeed the son of Silver, are you not?”
Ren nodded yes in response. Solphas’s face changed from a stern looking elder into the face of a much younger  when he smiled. This smile was qutie a strong one, exaggerating the anti aging effect.
“Welcome to our home, Ren Magic.” Solphas said.
Ren looked around for a moment, wondering who was the we Solphas spoke of. 
Solphas continued, “I understand you’ve brought a friend who’s been hurt.”
Ren responded with another head nod.
“I’ll let Maggie here tend to her wounds. Do not worry she is an excellent medicine woman. Isn’t that right Maggie?” Solphas turned smirking towards Maggie as he spoke.
“Thank you Solphas.” Maggie said. She stood up quickly and rushed out of the room. Maggie smiled at Ren as she passed by him to reach the exit. ben responded with a weak smile of his own. 
Maggie giggled on her way out.
Ren was still trying to figure out where he was exactly. Solphas answered his question, “You’re in the Arborians capital.”
“I didn’t know there were any more Arborians villages.” Ren said.
“There aren’t any like they used to be. This fort is a ghost of a time long gone.”
Ren was silent, as if out of respect for a loss. But then his curious quickly overcame that, “How do you know my father?”
“I knew him quite well. He saved our people from extinction.” Solphas said.
Ren aid nothing, but Solphas could see in his eyes that Ren was yearning to hear more about his father.
“You may have heard of the diaspora of the Arborians.”
“Yes, of course, but that was decades ago.” Ren said.
“I’m quite aware.” Solphas said.
Ren felt embarrassed of his impatience. Solphas continued, “Years later, after all the fighting had stopped, the human leaders of the time had ordered us surviving Arborians to either be apart of their advancing society or to build our homes in the woods. They promised the woods would be preserved for us. What I suspect the human leaders were well aware of at the time, was that these woods have always been home to some unusually nasty creatures.”
“Are we safe now?” Ren interjected. 
“Indeed we are Ren, thanks to your father.” Solphas replied, and with another breath he continued, “Your father led the fighting against the shadow beasts in the woods. It was thanks to his heroics that we were able to erect the fort you see before you.”
“But why not just come live in the city? Beedel seems to enjoy himself.” Ren asked.
“Beedel is a strange one. There are others like him, who’ve chosen to live amongst the technology, but the majority of our people feel most at home here in the woods.”
Just as Solphas finished his sentence Beedel strolled through the door as if being summoned by his name. Several other Arborians were still trying to greet him through the door. Solphas let out a rather loud, “Ahem.” Suddenly the Arborians scattered back out the door. This left only Ren, Beedel, and Solphas in the large tree house.
“Hey old man. How you been keeping?” Beedel said. Ren noticed how his words were familiar yet his tone had a great deal of respect.
“It is good to see you again Beedel.” Solphas spoke with a smile in his eyes.
“I hope this guy hasn’t been boring you with his stories, Renny.”
Ren shook his head, “No not at all. I have so many questions.”
Solphas acknowledged this, “Yes I’m sure Ren. I will try to answer as many of them as I can.” Solphas looked over towards Beedel. “There are things you might be interested in hearing as well, Beedel.” Ren and Beedel looked at each other then Solphas continued, “But first let us go upstairs and I can put on a pot of tea.”
Ren and Beedel had no objection to some hot tea after a long trip and followed Solphas up the spiralling staircase.
In a nearby, although much smaller tree house, Chloe was about to awaken.

            <Title>Chloe's Awakening</Title>
            <Text>The first thing Chloe saw when she woke up was the inside of a bark wall. IT was a foreign sight, definitely wooden she realized. But it was much different from the concrete walls she had fallen asleep within. 
	That’s when the memories returned to her.
	Chloe sat up suddenly, she ripped open several stitches as she did so and hollered in pain. Maggie was nearby. She had been moving Chloe’s blood stained clothes. But Chloe’s sudden movement and yell was startling enough for she to drop the clothes. 
	Maggie came to Chloe’s side quickly, trying to calm her, “It’s alright sugar. Just slow down.”
	Chloe was beginning to panic. Not only had she failed her quest last night, now she was caught, probably by an enemy she thought to herself. 
She tried to jerk free of Maggie’s grasp. The size difference made it a very simple task. Chloe’s flailing arms broke Maggie’s hold and knocked her to the ground. When Chloe realized she was free she tried to jump out of the bed. The wound was throbbing and halted her movements as she approached to the edge of the bed, which was much too small for her.
Chloe sat their bare chested, with a freshly open wound. The blood had begun again flowing down her abdomen. Chloe sat there for a moment looking at the blood. She had realized just how badly she’d been wounded. The gash covered the the length of her torso diagonally from her left hip to her right shoulder. She thought for a moment it was a miracle that her right breast had survived the attack. Although it was not without damage. 
There would be a nasty scar and Chloe’s first thoughts went out to Jak. Would he still want her body, if it looked like this. Chloe shook the insecurity out of her thoughts and refocused on the tasks at hand.
She had a moment to think as Maggie got up off the floor. Chloe just now noticed that she was dealing with a Arborians. She figured it would be best if she could calm down and gain as much information as possible from this Arborians.
Maggie got up slowly, she was without major damage, “We’re trying to help you child. Those brave boys brought you here with them. They could have left you for dead.”
Chloe turned slowly to face Maggie, “I’m sorry. I’m scared, where am I?”
Maggie smiled, “You’re in the forest. But most importantly you’re safe.”
“You meant the Great Woods?”
“Indeed, child.” 
“What about the Wooden Beasts?”
“Like I said, we’re safe. They call me, Maggie. What should I call you?”
Chloe stopped herself just before revealing her real name. She considered giving Umbra, but eventually decided it would be best to be honest to Maggie.
“My name is Chloe.”
“Glad to meet you Chloe.”
“Likewise, Maggie.”
The two girls smiled faintly to each other. Maggie grabbed some new bandages and some ointment from a nearby table. Turning back to Chloe, she spoke while gesturing to Chloe’s wound, “May I?”
Chloe nodded and Maggie began to tend her wound.
“How did a pretty girl like yourself, end up in such a troublesome state?”
Chloe felt very open to Maggie however she was not about to incriminate herself with the truth, “It’s a long story, Mags.”
Maggie smirked at the nickname. Chloe instinctively reached up to her neck as she spoke. Chloe’s eyes widened and shock ran through her entirety as she realized her newly acquired treasure was no longer dangling around her neck. 
Maggie immediately picked up on Chloe’s shock and addressed the situation, “It’s just over there.” Maggie was pointing towards Chloe’s clothes in a nearby armchair. They were all bunched up and on the top of them lay the glittering shine of Chloe’s necklace. The candlelight in the room made the gold appear brilliantly alive with motion.
Chloe sighed of relief. Maggie spoke again, appearing only to attempt conversation, “That’s an awfully beautiful necklace. Falling asleep in the home of a stranger is quite a risky move when sporting such valuable goods.”
“It was either that or the streets. I took my chances.” Chloe said. “Things seem to have turned out quite well, considering.”
“You are very trusting, child.” Maggie replied.
“Not always, it’s just that you’re very honest.” 
Maggie considered Chloe’s comment for a moment with a suspicious eying.
Chloe continued, “I’m very good at reading people.” They exchanged a smile, “I think I got very lucky.”
Maggie laughed as she continued to bandage the wound, “In more ways than one child.”
Maggie’s comment got Chloe thinking about the heist. As Maggie silently continued her work, Chloe lost herself in thought, trying to figure out what exactly went wrong.
“I’m going to try to use some magic to heal you now,” Maggie said, “If that’s okay with you?”
“Uh huh.” Chloe’s confirmation was distant, she had already begun walking through her memories, she was no longer in the room. Chloe was reliving the night before.

            <Title>The Heist</Title>
            <Text>The night was crisp. Umbra was leaning along the wall on the outside of a third story window. She had of course, navigated quickly from the train terminal to her grandmother’s estate. Everything was going according to plan. The estate was five stories tall, but her grandmother usually kept to the lower two floors. There were of course servants who might still be on these upper levels but Umbra was quite confident in her abilities.
	Umbra was still very much feeling the effects of the sensory enhancement powder. But even without such a drug every neuron in Umbra’s body would be firing with excitement. All of her training was none culminating to this moment. Her first real heist. It may be from her own family but the dangers of being caught were no less severe. Umbra’s parents, if they caught wind, would surely lock her away in some secure tower in a far off land. They might even hire a fire breathing monster to guard her from meddlesome heros.
That was besides the point and Umbra needed to focus. She snapped her attention back into the present and took  few deep breaths to center herself. She reached for the window and as expected, it was unlocked. Umbra entered the dark room with a silent grace. The combination of her skills and all the extra goodies she had on kept her movements in effectively total silence. 
The room she entered into was one Chloe had been quite familiar with as a child. It was a play room filled with all sorts of toys. The sort of room the children were locked inside when the adults needed a break. Chloe didn’t have many fond memories of this room. But it wouldn’t matter even if she did, Umbra was in control now. Chloe was sleeping softly in her subconsciousness, being called upon simply for directions.
Umbra reached the closed door of the large play room. Using a simple gesture and a barely audible spoken word she cast a small spell. Blue light began to gather around her eyes, clouding her vision. Then the clouds began to disperse. What what revealed was not the door Umbra was standing in front of, but the hallway beyond it. Umbra used this spectral eye to look around. No signs of movement, only the softly illuminated hallway could be seen.
Umbra opened the door and as she stepped out she swiftly cast two more spells. One to darken the area around her and the other to cushion her footsteps. She proceeded swiftly down the hall towards the main foyer. Umbra’s goal was in the basement, and luckily for her, Chloe’s knew about a secret passage from the third floor. It wasn’t a secret to anyone in her family, and it was often used as a source of entertainment for the children who visited grandmother’s house.
Just as Umbra reached the corner of the turning hallway, her hyper tuned ears began picking up the clanging of heavy metals. This did not slow her, as the sound was distant and her shadowing magic would prevent all but the most keen eyes from seeing her at any distance greater than a few meters.
She reached the foyer with good speed. The metal sounds were coming from the ground floor below. The foyer was a grand room three stories tall. It housed the main entrance doors which were the apotheosis of majestic wooden doors. 
The room’s main feature was the elaborate staircase connecting the three floors. With curves, twists, and turns it was one of the most interesting staircases in the land. One could be lost for hours just staring at it. Umbra however, was not lost, she had experienced the wonder of the staircase so many times now that they held little amazement for her.
The source of the metal sounds were two heavily armoured men standing at the feet of the stairs facing the doors. Umbra found this quite unusual. As far as she could remember there had never been much in the way of guards in her grandmother’s home, and she had visited not so long ago. Many of the servants were trained in certain defensive magical arts, but power armour was never their attire of choice. 
Umbra was contemplating this for several moments until more clanging metal from down the hall on the same floor as herself awoken her to the present. These sounds were accompanied by slow footsteps. Umbra jumped quickly back into action. 
At the very center of the room there was a large angelic statue. Umbra quickly cast another spell making sure to speak as softly as possible and hoping the small burst of light would not catch the attention of the guards below. It didn’t, her silence spell went off without a hitch. She then quickly pulled the praying arms of the angle downward like a lever. They swung back up forcefully which would have normally made a loud clunking noise. However currently no noise was being omitted from a two meter spherical area around Umbra.
Below the statue a small hatch slid open to reveal a tubed slide. Umbra could see from the hallway she had come from, a small light growing brighter around the corner. No time to sit around, she needed to move. So she jumped down the tube with a fearlessly associated with actions previously performed a countless number of times.
The small hatch quickly closed up behind her. The familiarity of this slide was striped away wit the soundlessness of her magic. Her memories could vividly recall the screeching sounds as Chloe and her cousins would slide down into the basement. Although the whole house would know someone was sliding so this spell had been practiced specifically for this moment. Every detail of this heist had been meticulously preplanned. That is why the armoured guards gave Chloe such a nervous sensation.
After the short ride down the slide, Umbra now found herself in the basement. Most of the lights were out, but that didn’t stop Umbra’s heightened sense from seeing the rooms around her. The room was shaped like a fat T. She had ejected from the slide right of the intersection pointing towards the bottom of the T. The hatch was now sliding closed behind her. On either side down the hallways Umbra could sense no movement. She seemed to be alone down here.
Umbra proceeded forward down towards the the far end of the T shaped room. The only visible light source were a couple of flickering magical flames, that burned using raw energy from the circuitry in the house rather than traditional fuels like the rest of the house. Between these two flames, a large circular vault door took up most of the available real estate of the wall. The mechanics behind this vault door were in no way suited to the rest of the house. Chloe’s grandmother wished to use traditional materials and old style mechanics throughout the house. Even the trap door slide was a simple pulley system. Grandma Rendal avoided advanced magical tech at all costs. Except when it came to this vault.
Chloe had even once been inside the vault. Her grandmother was not so shy about showing of her collection of precious jewels and items from around the world. There were many treasures which could be easily worth millions but none of those were Umbra’s target. No Umbra’s target was a small trinket, a gold necklace. When Grandma Rendal was questioned about this specific necklace she practically shrugged it off as worthless. 
In a way that’s what intrigued Umbra even more, why would her Grandmother, in all respects a lover of expensive items, keep such a worthless necklace among her real treasures. Umbra had always been suspicious of this and finding the truth of about this necklace was more important than making a big score on an expensive theft.
Now for the tricky part, infiltrating the vault. The vault was metallic and multilayered. But Umbra had a plan for this too. She wouldn’t have come if she didn’t. Her grandmother slept with the only key to the vault door. So Umbra had to be creative. Jak had helped her develop a spell for just such an occasion. Umbra stopped about ten meters from the door. A few deep breaths to prepare herself, she only had one shot at this.
She lifted her foot and slowly took a step forward. The moment that foot hit the ground she sprung forward at full speed. She had no intention of stopping as the door quickly approached. She whispered the familiar chant and just prior to releasing the energy of the spell Umbra leaped forward on a collision course with the vault door. Mid air she released the spell. Umbra did not brace for impact, as her body became translucent she passed through the vault door as if it wasn’t even there.
She wasn’t in the clear yet however. Just as she passed through into the other room Umbra quickly released the spell. The timing had to be just right and she needed to move her body into a horizontal head first dive just make it worked. She smashed her head against the floor and was glad to feel the pain rattled through her entire body. The alternative was a far worse possibility. Solidifying part way through the floor was no way to behave during a professional heist.
She had fallen through the floor of Jak’s apartment several times in practice. Leaving more than a few of Jak’s patron’s at a loss for words. But all the failures had paid off. Now she only had to do it once more on her way out and everything would be gravy.
The vault room was pitch black except for the greenish glow of one odd sphere kept near the back of the room. It wasn’t nearly enough light, even for Umbra’s heightened senses. With a quick flick of her finger Umbra produced a small flame out of her thumb. This provided more than enough light.
It had been a few year since Umbra had been inside the vault so either things had been moved around quite a bit or her memories weren’t as precise as she’d believed. Probably both she decided.
The magic she used to get through the door had cancelled both the silencing and shadowy spells previously cast. This didn’t bother Umbra, she was plenty safe from guards inside here.
Umbra began searching the room. The vault was surprising large and took up a great portion of the basement level. Umbra continued to search for some time. She was starting to get impatient and was quite tempting to relief her grandmother of some other trinket in place of her original goal. But just as the thoughts started to become solidified in her mind, Umbra spotted it. It was right near the entrance and she had missed it on her first pace. She was still a good deal away from it. She only noticed it because it reflected the light from her thumb flame so beautifully. 
Then a loud blast and two loud thuds muffled, yet audible through the ceiling interrupted her appreciation of her goal. The thuds came from directly above her, she figured she was right near the front entrance and those two armoured guards from earlier. There were no more sounds for some time.
Umbra took no time at all to run to her goal. The simple glass case surrounding it made no attempt to stop Umbra from acquiring her goal. She appreciated the necklace for just a moment, it was much more beautiful than she remembered. With intricate carvings all over the metal. Even the robe was tightly woven silk, it had much strength to it.
Umbra opened the clasp and placed the necklace around her neck, hiding it underneath her clothes. Just as she finished adjusting her clothes, the vault door opened. Umbra immediately extinguished her thumb light, but it was too late already.
The figure on the other side of the door was a tall woman. She wore a revealing form fitting outfit which left very little to the imagination. On top of her shoulders was a heavy cloak and on her head she wore a large pointed hat. She’s a wizard Umbra thought immediately. It was a natural assumption based off of her clothing, but it was quite obvious based on the fact the she was floating.
The woman turned her head towards Umbra, “Oh another guard, even in here?”
Umbra’s every instinct was telling her to run. Not only was she caught, but caught by a wizard. She still had her tools, she could still escape with enough luck. Umbra barely missed a beat. 
She charged the wizard. As predicted the wizard immediately responded by charging some kind of magical attack. Umbra watched carefully and just as the blast was launched Umbra blinked instantly to the right and past the wizard. This magic allows you to travel a short distance in the blink of an eye. Umbra blinked several more times and cleared the distance to the other side of hte room in mere seconds.
If she would’ve continued blinking she may have even escaped. This was her major mistake. Her curiosity got the better of her and she paused to look back at the wizard. At that moment Umbra saw the astral blade flying towards her. It was too late to blink the blade had cut her deeply across her chest. 
Umbra fell to the floor and thought that this was the end. But to her surprise the wizard did not continue to attack. In fact the wizard he gone deeper into the vault and was now ignoring Umbra. Thankfully the adrenaline of the situation combined with the effects of the sensory drug gave Umbra the strength needed to continue moving. 
She began blinking her way towards the stairs and up to the first floor. By the time she got there she was already out of breathe and feeling the pain worsen. Blinking wasn’t the most stable of spells and it seemed to aggravate her wound. For now she’d have to run.
It was hard to ignore the bleeding guards on the floor. It was also hard to ignore the huge hole blasted through the large doors. Hardest of all to ignore was the potential that her grandmother was in danger, or worse that she was already dead. But Umbra ignored it all. She ran as fast as her body would allow towards the city and away from her grandmother’s estate.

            <Title>BugBot's Adventure Vol. 3</Title>
            <Text>BugBot had followed his two targets deep into the bowels of the tunnels. They had gone several levels down and past a great many guarded outposts. These outposts were guarded by wardens. Very well equipped wardens BugBot noticed.
	BugBot could sense that they were drawing near the a great source of power. He was prepared to emit a signal to Beedel at a moment’s notice. Bugbot would die for Beedel, but a true failure would be to neglect sending such vital information before death. Bugbot hadn’t had a chance yet because his targets were constantly on the move and he didn’t want to get left behind while transmitting.
	Plus if BugBot could transmit a location even closer to the power source it would help Beedel even more so. They were getting awfully close to that power source now.
	The targets had ceased their conversations and were walking mostly in silence. The wizard woman  was leading the way and Krozan appeared almost lost. It seemed he and BugBot would be seeing the source for the first time together. This was the ideal situation for BugBot, if he could send location data to Beedel from the actual source it could make their hunt that much more effective.
	Finally the dark tunnels gave way to an opening. This cavern had the size of a grand cathedral. The room was alight with a stream of raw energy flowing upwards. It glowed greenish blue, but seemed to be slowly shifting towards a deeper blue. 
The tunnel gave way to a metal walkway which suspended itself outward into the room. BugBot could not see much detail about the grand room from his perspective and he didn’t dare move any closer. His two targets had stopped just the opening. It appeared Krozan needed a moment to experience his awe. BugBot was however, still within mechanical earshot.
Krozan began after a few stunned moments, “This is enormous. Who built this?”
The wizard only gave Krozan a look with two raised eyebrows.
“Right,” said Krozan, “dumb question.”
The wizard signalled Krozan to take a couple steps forward, past the boundary of the doorway. Once Krozan began moving she followed quickly behind him. BugBot too followed them, but at a greater distance.
As soon as he passed the threshold Krozan turned back to the wizard with a stunned expression, “It’s so saturated here.” he said.
“Of course,” she replied, “this is the core of energy generation in our city.” She ushered Krozan further along the walkway. 
BugBot was closer now as well and he could make out a little more detail about the room. It appeared the room was as deep as it was tall, perhaps more so. There were also several other walkways meeting in the center of the circular room and all pointing outwards in equally angular directions.
The center of the room contained a platform raised a few meters from the level of the walkways. It contained several consoles and control apparatus upon it. BugBot had found his goal. This was likely the central node of the entire power system. BugBot would have access to all of the information, if he could just sneak his way by the two blocking his path.
As those two continued walking along the walkway they stopped at a large pillar halfway down the radius of the room. The walkway wrapped around this pillar in a circular fashion. The pillar was made of a near-black stone with some purple hue shining through. It had an elliptical shape, the thickest part of which stood just two meters above the walkway. Upon closer examination BugBot could make out that this was no pillar at all, for the ends came to a sharp point and there was no contact to any surface including the walkway. This giant ebony spike was floating, but no it that soft flowing way that you might associated with things like bubbles. This pillar was as sturdy as a mountain.
It was only have BugBot risked getting just a tad closer that he was able to see that each walkway had one of these spikes midway from the center. Six in total. The purpose of these spikes elluded BugBot, he was not designed to do much creative thinking. But he was designed to seek out and retrieve information, and that he had.
The wizard began speaking to Krozan from in front of the ebony spike, “Beautiful aren’t they?”
Krozan shrugged a weak yes.
“Here, let me show you the artifact.” The wizard waved her arm at the spike and a small portion in the middle began fading away. It revealed a small golden trinket, hovering inside the spike. “We have five now. We need only to collect the sixth to begin the operation.”
Krozan looked concerned, “But Elizaborah, you lost the sixth.” The look on Krozan’s face showed tht he knew he was being disrespectful, and immediately regretted it.
Elizaborah, the wizard, gave Krozan a firm look.
Krozan added, ‘What I mean, uh… is how do you plan on retrieving the last artifact?”
The stern looked faded from Elizaborah’s face and the calm smile returned. “This is why I’ve brought you here Krozan. To show you what they look like.”
Krozan looked puzzled but he nodded his head hoping she would go on explaining.
She did, “I have some of that brat’s blood. Soon I’ll have a tracking solution and you will go find her for me.”
Krozan eyes were swinging back and forth, he was still putting all the pieces together in his mind. It didn’t take very long, but it was noticeable to the observant eye.
Elizaborah continued, “You’ve proven yourself very reliable, Krozan.” She simultaneously placed a hand on Krozan’s arm and used her other hand to wave the spike back into an oblique state. “We could use more men like you in the association.”
“You’re too kind Elizaborah,” Krozan stuttered out. “My only desire is to serve you.”
“You’ve done mighty fine job of that. But now I need you to help me find this girl.” Elizaborah said.
During this exchange BugBot had been analyzing the situation and looking for a route he could take in order to reach the central computer. He had to be cautious, BugBot could tell that these two would be no fumbling buffoons like Stephen and Carson. But he figured he’d be able to sneak quietly enough by the if he walked on the underside of the walkway.
So BugBot prepared to do just that. He approached the walkway and as he came close to the edge of the doorway he could sense the immense pressure from all the magical energy in the next room. If BugBot had been programmed to feel fear, he may have hesitated, or even decided upon a different course of action. However BugBot was not programed with fear in mind.
The moment one of BugBot’s appendages crossed the boundary into the large room the two, standing a good distance away, noticed immediately. As did BugBot, he didn’t calculate that the energy field would be so strong that it would amplify their senses.
Krozan immediately turned to face the threat. “Someone’s here.”
Elizaborah’s reaction was much slowly and deliberately controlled, “I’m aware, shall we find the intruder.”
“Aye.” Krozan replied.
BugBot realized that they noticed something but not precisely. It was time to cut his loses. He might not be able to escape from these two, and failing without sending any data to Beedel was not an option. So BugBot scurried back into the darkness of the tunnel a slight ways and up the wall into the corner where he dug himself and nice cozy hole. BugBot planted his claws deep into the dirt and reoriented most of his body mass to the exterior of the hole hoping to conceal and defend.
Then with haste and urgency BugBot began transmitting as much data as possible to Beedel’s receiver. It wasn’t long before Krozan came rushing down the walkway, with his hunting eyes in full scan. Elizaborah followed slowly behind carefully scanning the areas Krozan may have missed. If there were any robotic Gods, BugBot’s praying would have made a lot of more sense.

            <Title>The Old Story Keeper</Title>
            <Text>They walked up several flights of stairs. Each floor presented a different scene, as if each was designed for a different purpose. One had plenty of art supplies, another had a old style loom, the one they had just passed was clearly a breakfast nook. The floor they were approaching now appeared to be a lounge, perhaps designated for reading. This is where they stopped.
Solphas hopped onto an old cushion, it was quite large and could easily serve as a bed for the old man. Ren took a seat on a nearby chair that was just slightly too small for him. Beedel joined them fitting comfortably in a nearby chair.
Solphas took just a moment to catch his breath and then began to speak once more, “Ren, you’re father is a hero to our people.” Ren's attention focused directly on Solphas. “It is because of his courage that this city is still here. He almost singlehandedly fought back against the shadow beasts in the dark woods, giving up time to fortify and build up our homes.”
Ren didn’t much care to hear about his father’s exploits. Ren had only one question in mind, “Do you know where my father is now?”
The room remained silent for a moment, the question echoed through the tree house. 
Solphas opened his mouth, but before any sound let out, Beedel interrupted, “He’s not here Renny.”
Solphas added, “He went west. To beyond the mountains.”
“Why?!” Ren cried, “Why did he leave?”
Ren explosive question took Solphas aback. After he regained composure Solphas began to explain, “Your father, Silver, went into hiding. He also went to investigate another mystery.”
“What could be beyond the mountains. It’s said there’s nothing but desert and death beyond.” Ren questioned.
“Indeed that is what’s said, but there is far more than that. A whole civilization in fact.” Solphas returned, and then he continued, “Your father is safe, he made contact not long ago. If you stay with us, you may even be able to speak with him the next time he calls.”
“I’d like that.” Ren said.
Beedel asked, “It’s been a long time since you’ve seen him hasn’t it?” 
Ren merely nodded in response.
Solphas continued,”Indeed Silver has been gone for many years. It is indeed because our great land is in deep trouble.” Solphas turned to address Beedel, “How much have you explained Beedel?”
“Only up to the inconsistencies in the power supply.” Beedel thought for a moment, “And a little about the wizards who get commissioned.”
“And how exactly do you know all this?” Ren questioned.
“A have a few little friends who’ve helped me gather data.” Beedel answered.
“Yes,” Solphas added, “Beedel has been collecting information for us. Most Arborians are resistant to the ways of advancing technology, however a rare few seem to breathe it in.” Solphas looked over to Beedel with a keen eye. “Beedel has selflessly been living among the enemy, in constant danger, to gather what info he can.”
“It hasn’t been that selfless, I actually prefer to live in the city.” Beedel added.
“Even so, you risk your life for not only us Arborians but all people in the land.” Solphas rebuttled.
Ren interrupted, “Sorry, but what is this great threat?”
“Ren,” Solphas began, “Before we reveal everything to you, let me ask you one question.” 
Ren nodded.
“Why are you here?” Ren wasn’t quite sure what Solphas meant and was about to ask for clarification when Solphas continued, “I mean to say, knowing what I know about Beedel, you’re interactions were likely very bizarre. Yet you trusted him. He could have been some insane Arborians.” Solphas and Beedel exchanged a quick smile. “So Ren, why have you ventured so far from home with a stranger you barely know? Why do you trust us?”
“Well I’m not sure I do, exactly.” Ren began, but he trailed off. He started staring at his hands, an old habit whenever he faced tough questions.
Solphas let him think for a moment and then added, “Trust is not in the mind, it is in what we do.”
Ren lifted his gaze and met with Solphas’s eyes. Those eyes were full of compassion and wisdom, it was a inviting gaze. So Ren tried to explain himself, “I’m here because I’ve felt that something was wrong in the association, no in the whole city. It’s been this way for a very long time. Yet whenever I would even slightly hint at the idea I received backlash from higher ups, from coworkers.” Ren paused and looked towards Beedel, “Beedel was the first person to ever acknowledge this and he seemed to have data to prove it.”
“Just wait Renny,” Beedel added, “Soon we will have even more data for you.”
“What do you mean?” Ren questioned.
“Yes Beedel, have you located the source?” Solphas questioned as well.
Beedel had a confident smile from ear to ear. “Yes, or rather I will soon. Renny here, helped me infiltrate into the association’s system. Soon BugBot will be positioned somewhere...”
Ren interrupted, “That metal bug thing was yours?”
“Yes,” Beedel responded, “BugBot.”
“I don’t know if that thing will be okay.” Ren added.
“What? Why?” Beedel demanded.
“Well the last I saw it was sort of being chased and shot at by several wizards.” Ren said.
Beedel was silent for a moment. Then he added, “Well, I doubt a few wizards could be much of a match for…”
Beedel was interrupted by a triplet of tones coming from his pocket. Reactively to the sound he pulled out a small device and began tapping it. It illuminated his face as he spoke, “See, speak of a demon and he shall appear. That’s BugBot now.”
Solphas readjusted himself in his seat and spoke, “Beedel why is that gadget within the city limit?”
But Beedel did not register anything Solphas had said. His attention was deep into the message sent by BugBot and his face was growing solemn.
“BugBot found it.” Beedel began, “The source of all the power in Novos.”
Both Solphas and Ren were waiting patiently for Beedel to continue. 
“The transmission was cut short but I have the coordinates and a power reading. The power is off the charts.”
“But we knew that.” Ren said.
“Not like this. Renny this is, this is ridiculous. 300 Tera-Arcs.”
Ren remembered in his previous talk with Beedel they were discussing power outputs in tens of Mega-Arcs, this was seven orders of magnitude greater than that. “What in the world could all that power be used for?” Ren asked.
“Nowhere in this world, Ren.” Solphas added.
“There’s just no way.” Ren said, “There must be a mistake in the readings.”
“No.” Beedel snapped, “BugBot sent three different signals before they got him.” 
Ren turned to Solphas, “Where could they possibly be stealing all this energy from?”
“The core.” Solphas said.
Ren waited patiently for further explanation, Solphas was struggling to get the words out.
“The core of the planet. They’re stealing energy from the planet itself.” Solphas said, and then he muttered, “Fools.”
“Wait, wouldn’t taking energy from the planet’s core be extremely dangerous?” Ren asked.
“Yes, it is, yet they do it anyway.” Solphas responded.
“Why?” Ren asked the simple question.
“There’s much more to this problem then just Novos, Ren.” Solphas began, “All of our lands are being oppressed, and it is not by the wizard association.”
“Then who?” Ren asked.
“The true rulers of this world. Beings from another world.” Solphas answered.
“What?” The thing Ren could muster.
“There’s a hidden history to these lands.” Solphas’s speech trailed off as he looked up to address the guests now coming up the stairs. “It seems we have company boys.”
Maggie and Chloe were now standing at the top of the stairs. Chloe was heavily bandaged and wearing a shirt of Maggie’s that was much to small.
“I wanted to thank you for saving me.” Chloe said.
Ren was shocked. He was so enthralled in the conversation he had not heard the women approach them. He stuttered for a second trying to get the words out, then Beedel cut him off, “Renny here is the one responsible for that.”
“Then thank you, Renny.” Chloe uttered.
“Uh, you’re welcome.” Ren began, “And it’s, uh, Ren actually. Ren Magic.”
“Oh?” Chloe looked puzzled. “But Renny is so much cuter.”
“I know right!” Beedel added.
“Enough children.” Solphas’s voice boomed through the room. “Maggie, is she alright?”
“Yes, she’s still a bit woozy but there’s no need to worry.” Maggie replied.
“Yes,” Chloe said, “and if you don’t mind I’d like to be going.”
“Not just yet child,” Maggie said then she turned to Solphas, “She had one of the artifacts with her.” Solphas was silent in thoughtful shock and Maggie continued, “It could be the last one.”
“I’m well aware.” Solphas replied. 
Ren interjected, “Wait what artifact?”
“Is it off similar nature to your father’s Golden Bullets.” Solphas replied and then turned to Chloe, “Perhaps you could stay with us for just awhile longer. I think you might be interested in what in the story I have to tell.”
“I’m afraid you’re mistaken,”Chloe said, looking towards Maggie, “I don’t have any artifacts with me.”
Solphas gave a small nod towards Maggie, she then revealed Chloe’s golden necklace from a pocket in her dress.
“That’s my grandmother’s necklace, give it back!” Chloe burst out. She prepared her body to make an escape if things went south, but made no attempt to take back the necklace from the small Arborians. 
Maggie handed the necklace over to Solphas. He examined it careful, by holding the lace high above his head, becoming eye level with the golden trinket.
“This is indeed what we’ve been searching for.” Solphas said.
“No way, really pops?” Beedel asked rhetorically.
“And what does this have to do with my father?” Ren demanded.
“Give it back!” Chloe yelled.
“SILENCE!” Solphas’s shout nearly deafened them all. It most certainly silenced them. He took a minute to regain his composure, and capture his breath. Once he readjusted himself in his seat he began to speak, quietly once again, “Allow me to explain. Please take a seat miss. Maggie, please go fetch us some tea.” 
Maggie smiled and left without another word.
Solphas then turned to Chloe, “Is this really was your grandmother’s then you must be a Rendal. May I ask your first name?”
Chloe was shocked but she answered anyway, “It’s Chloe. My name is Chloe.”
“Oh yes indeed, how very fitting.” Solphas responded then he turned his attention to Ren, “Ren, do you have any Golden Bullets with you?”
Ren was similarly shocked and answered  , “Uhm. What?”
“He has got one with him!” Beedel interjected. 
“There’s no need to hide things from us Ren. We are on your side.” Solphas said. “Your father had used them before. It’s only natural to assume he’d leave some to his son.”
“Well yeah, he did.” Ren began, “ But I don’t think they are real.”
“And why is that?” Solphas questioned.
“Well because,” Ren looked around the room only to notice that all eyes were on him, “I guess I’ve never tested them. I mean wouldn’t a test be a waste of such a bullet?”
“I understand why you would think that.” Solphas replied, “You have no idea what they do, do you?”
Ren shook his head.
“Ren.” Solphas began, “These bullets are more than just projectiles. They can manifest the pure desires of those who use them.”
Chloe couldn’t help but interrupt at this point, “So the bullet grants wishes?”
“It’s a little more complicated than that.” Solphas said. “But yes.”
There was a long pause while the other three tried to wrap their brains around a wish granting bullet. Solphas let their wheels spin for a while but then he returned to his explanation.
“The amulet of Chloe’s necklace is made of the same material as these bullets. However it is not gold as you might assume.” Solphas raised the necklace up to the light, staring at it as he spoke, “Etherium. Although it appears like a brilliant gold, it is not of this world.”
“Get to the wish granting part already.” Chloe interrupted.
“Show some respect.” Beedel snapped.
“That’s alright Beedel.” Solphas responded, “The special properties of this material create an extreme amplification of arcane energy. the same energy that resides throughout the universe and within us. Wizards use this inner energy to achieve great feats of magic. With the enough energy a wizard can directly alter the very fabric of the universe.” Solphas paused for dramatic effect. “The Etherium amplifies the energy within the user and grants more than enough energy for world changing magic.”
“That’s how the grand wizards are generating all that power!” Ren exclaimed.
“Clever.” Solphas agreed, “But not quite. When a wizard uses the Etherium it gets used up in a short burst of extreme energy. However they may be using it in conjunction with a huge amount of natural energy.”
“Where would they find so much natural energy?” Ren asked.
Solphas looked over to Beedel who had just now solved the problem in his mind.
“The planet’s core.” Beedel said.
“Unfortunately so.” Solphas confirmed.
“Whoa, just what?” Ren uttered, “That explains where all the energy is coming from. But not where it’s going.”
“It’s going into space.” Solphas said, “our planet is being syphoned of all it’s energy. This process cannot be maintained and eventually our entire world will collapse.”
“So let me get this straight,” Chloe spoke up, “Our world is controlled by alien overlords who have given us a powerful material so that they can steal all the energy our world has to offer?”
The sharpness of Chloe words ranged through the room around them.
“Yes, that’s right Chloe.” Solphas responded and then he added, “They’ve also given controlled the tides of wars since the beginning of our history. They shaped this planet to suit their needs from the very beginning.”
“Well how do we stop them?” Chloe asked.
Solphas smiled at her enthusiasm and replied, “You three must go back to Novos. Infiltrate their lair and find the main terminal which controls all the power and destroy it.”
Ren began to feel the overwhelming sense of fear that had become so very familiar to him, “How are we supposed to do that?” He yelled, “She’s badly wounded and I’m a bad shot. Beedel is the only one worth a damn in fighting power and even he couldn’t take on the whole of the association's power.”
“Speak for yourself Renny.” Beedel replied and then gave Ren a wink that he said he’d happily try to fight the entire association alone if he needed to.
“And I’m fine.” Chloe added, “Maggie is a wonderful healer, better in fact than any doctor I’ve ever met.”
“Thank you child.” Maggie replied from behind Chloe. Her soft footsteps had gone unnoticed by the chatting group.
“No thank you Maggie. You really did a number on this wound.” Chloe said.
“Okay I get it. You all are so eager to rush off to fight the government. But that still doesn’t answer my question of how we are going to pull it off.
“Well,” Chloe began, “I’m also known as Umbra, an expert thief.”
“And I’ve got detailed information on how to reach the core from BugBot’s transmission.” Beedel added.
“Ren,” Solphas began, “you have your father's skill and you have a golden bullet.”
“I have three,” Ren added, “But I’m no gunslinger like my father. I use cheap trick bullets to work around my shortcomings.”
“You know your weakness Ren. The enemy cannot take advantage of you if you are aware of your own weaknesses. Your father taught you much, you will see.” Solphas assured Ren.
“And wow you have three of those golden bullets! There’s no way we can lose.” Beedel added.
“Alright I guess that’s right fair. And Solphas I suppose you could train me in how to use the golden bullets, couldn’t you?” Ren asked.
“No can do Beeny.” Beedel interjected, “We have to leave ASAP.”
“What? Why?” Ren questioned.
“Because,” Solphas answered, “BugBot was discovered and they know you’re coming. The sooner you move the better.”
	“Oh.” Ren slouched in defeat.
	“We have some time, Renny.” Beedel said, “I need to make a few modifications to the BulletCar and then we’re off. I’m sure old Solphas’ll teach ya something in that time.”
	“But why just the three of us?”Ren asked Solphas, “Can’t any of your people come along to fight?”
	“Ren,” Beedel answered, “Our people are not fighters like the draconians, and we cannot master magic like you humans. Even in my very rare case, where the sight of technology doesn’t repulse me, I can only use my customized power armour to fight.”
	“Indeed,” Solphas added, “even if we went against of naturally peaceful ways, we wouldn’t be much help on the battlefield.”
	“I understand.” Ren said, “The Arborians have always be known as peaceful. My father spoke very highly of that fact.”
	“Right,” Beedel said, “It was nice seein you old man. I’m gonna go get the BulletCar ready.”
	“Take care my son.” Solphas responded. And they hugged a foreign yet warm hug.
	“Child,” Maggie said as she pulled as Chloe’s wrist, “come with me and I’ll change your bandages and give you some ointment to go.”
	“Okay Maggie,” Chloe said and she began to follow Maggie down stairs. As she did she turned to Ren and spoke, “Thank you Ren. For saving me.”
	Ren began to blush, “It was nothing.”
	Now Ren was once again alone with Solphas. 
Solphas took a deep breath and began, “Alright, I’ll start from the beginning. Are you ready?”

            <Title>The Journey Home</Title>
            <Text>Barely a day has passed since Ren and Beedel had fled the city of Novos with the unconscious Chloe. But now again the three of them were back inside Beedel’s BulletCar and headed back to the city. They just reached the city’s outskirts and were moving along at a dangerous pace. Beedel was sitting cautiously in his armour, at the helm of the violently fast lump of metal. 
Chloe had been mostly dosing in the back seat for the duration of the ride, waking occasionally to ask the same repeated question, “How far now?”
Beedel responded after a short sigh, “Not long now.”
“So where to first?” Chloe questioned.
“First,” Ren responded, “ we head back to my place to gather the other two Golden Bullets.”
“Then we head to Wizard Headquarters and blast the door in.” Beedel added.
“Won’t that get us fried by dozens wizards?” Chloe inquired.
“Not if we do it right!” Beedel responded.
“I’m with Chloe.” Ren added, “The Wizards in the Association's headquarters have some serious firepower.”
“Ren's right.” Chloe said. “We can’t just walk right into their front door and say ‘Um hello. We’re here to stop you.’ We need a plan.”
“Renny…” Beedel began before Ren cut him off.
“No Beedel, I think she’s right.”
“Renny listen.”
“I know you’re upset about your little robot friend. What was his name…” Ren interrupted again.
“Renny enough I get it.”
“Ah right! BugBot. You’re upset about BugBot and you need to calm down.”
“Ren!” Beedel screamed.
The rage had startled Ren less than half as much as the use of his proper name from Beedel’s voice.
Ren's gaze followed Beedel’s arm, hand and then index finger as it pointed out the front window towards a billowing black smoke coming directly from the lot where Ren's house used to be.
They were still a couple blocks away from Ren's house but the smoke was clearly coming from his corner lot.
Chloe began, “So much for that plan.”
“God no…” Ren could barely speak.
“It’s alright Renny.” Beedel began, “we still got one of those bullets. And we got Chloe’s artifact too.”
“Yeah,” Chloe added, “If we act quickly we can still catch them off guard.”
Ren remained silent. Despair began to grow within him.
“Speaking of off guard.” Beedel said, then he jerked the wheel suddenly to the left and the whole car flung itself with unnatural inertia away from the approaching smoke cloud. “Better we stay clear of your place, Ren.”
“Yeah.” Ren replied.
“I know a spot we can hold up.” Chloe said. “It’s not far from here. Just make a left after this corner.”

            <Title>Return To The Scene Of The Crime</Title>
            <Text>The estate was exactly how Chloe remembered it; destroyed.
	“Chloe,” Ren said, “what happened here?” Ren looked around at the bodies of several guards scattered around the front entrance.
	Chloe took a breath and meant to respond but before she could her eyes made contact with a small body lying in a bloody housecoat. Chloe ran to her grandmother’s side, into the darkness of the huge home. Ren and Beedel followed her.
	Chloe could only cry. It was an ugly sob, one full of regret and rage.
	“Chloe,” Ren tried to find the words, “is this your grandmother’s house.”
	Chloe made no response.
	“Renny, let’s give her a minute.” Beedel said.
	“No!” Chloe screamed. “We leave as soon as possible.” Chloe pulled the necklace away from her neck and held it up toward them as she spoke. “They want this and I’m going to be the one to use it and destroy them.”
	Ren and Beedel remained silent and let her continue without interruption. 
	“That bitch killed my grandmother. I should have been here to protect her.” Chloe began to sob again. “No more running.” The silence was heavy. “What do we do now?” She asked.
	“We fight.” Ren replied.
	“I have a plan.” Beedel said. “Things are about to get real messy.”
	The other two looked at Beedel with puzzled faces. Beedel smiled back, his face full of mischief.

            <Title>The Lobby</Title>
            <Text>The collection of buildings under the Wizard Association’s control is quite vast and spread throughout the city. However their headquarters is by far the most impressive structure in the whole city. They call it the Wizard’s Tower and it stands tall, looming over the surrounding structures.
	The interior lobby of the Wizard Tower is a pristine foyer. The architecture inside dwarves the expensive art which covers most of the wall space.
	Meanwhile busy Wizards buzz to and from, up and down and all around the room. Some are flying, others are running, and far more are taking their sweet time. There are a few Wizards who dedicate their time to sitting at the front desk to greet and direct guests. This is most unusual considering the number of guests who visit the Wizard Tower is impressively low.
	One of these receptionists fancies herself quite good at her job. In many way she is, but what she doesn’t fully realize is that even though she has talent, she’s chosen a path that has very little progression in the association. That wouldn’t much bother her anyway. She’s quite content with her life and her job. Her name is Leeza.
	This day was bright and hopeful for Leeza. It was the day before her vacation began. But that didn’t stop Leeza from doing her work. She was powering through stronger than ever.
	It was just past midday. It was an especially busy day for Wizardry, which meant a busy day in the lobby and for Leeza. She had just finished helping a Wizard Apprentice when she started to hear it.
	At first Leeza wasn’t sure she heard anything at all. But it was getting louder. It took a few concentrated moments to decipher the sound. If she was more familiar with mundane engines she might have realized sooner that it was a vehicle speeding towards the entrance. 
	But it was too late. 
	Everything was so sudden. Many Wizards reacted out of instinct. A loud crash followed by a roaring engine had just burst its way through their front door. It caused quite the chaos. The majority Wizards, especially those unaccustomed to using magic for defense, only added to the confusion.
	But the few Wizards present who were trained in defensive arts, it would only take a few, reacted so fiercely that the speeding metal vehicle spend very little time actually inside the building. Within seconds those adept wizards had reduced the menacing rolling weapon to little more than ash.
	But unfortunately that was the easy part. The wizards in panic remained in panic, many of which causing more damage and panic themselves. Even those who had reduced the existence of the assault to a mere dust pile were beginning to panic as they suspected the assault to continue.
Leeza was the only living thing in the room not panicking, which is saying something when you consider that much of the furniture was on it’s way out the doors. But Leeza was frozen in shock.
The speeding bullet with wheels had been headed directly for her. Leeza’s life even flash somewhere in front of her eyes.However just before she was rescued by the other Wizards she had time to notice one small detail about her oncoming doom.
The car was empty.

            <Title>Back Into The Tunnels</Title>
            <Text>It had taken no time at all for Ren, Beedel, and Chloe to reach the tunnels. They entered via the same way Ren and Beedel had previously exited. They had been following Beedel who was following the signal sent by BugBot for several minutes now. 
	Ren was on guard and ready with his pistol loaded. He hadn’t loaded the Golden Bullet, since he only had one left he decided it would be best to save it.
	Chloe was similarly prepared with her knife in hand. She had also cast a quieting spell upon them. Chloe’s wound had all but totally healed at this point. Maggie’s hard work and magic had proved itself quite effective.
	“Can that device of yours really lead us through the tunnels?” Ren asked.
	“Well,” Beedel began, “I sure hope so. I’m following the data BugBot transmitted, but these tunnels are all irregular. It may take a while.”
	“If only Grummin was around to lead us through.” Ren said.
	“Who’s Grummin?” Chloe asked.
	“A good friend. And a skilled warden.” Ren replied.
	Beedel continued to focus on the data, trying to navigate while Ren and Chloe walked closely behind.
	“The wardens are lizardfolk correct?” Chloe asked.
	“draconians, yes.” Ren replied.
	“And aren’t they extremely loyal to the wizards?” Chloe questioned.
	“Usually, yes.” Ren answered. “Why?”
	“Well I’ve never seen one before, do they look like that guy up ahead?” She asked.
	“What?” Beedel exclaimed.
	Beedel’s shout alerted the warden up ahead at the next junction. He turned and saw the three intruders. He signaled to someone just out of sight and began rushing forward. Following him were three other wardens, all of which were very heavily armed.
	The tunnel they were all in now had no other option besides forward or back. Beedel stepped forward, the thrusters in his armour began revving.
	“You two get to the core, I’ll hold them off here.” Beedel said.
	“No.” Ren stepped forward. He grabbed Beedel’s shoulder and their brief eye contact was all Beedel needed to back down. Ren had a fierceful calm look on his face.
	The wardens stopped a few paces away and began to question them, “Unauthorized personnel are not permitted in these parts of the tunnels. You will be escorted back now or else…” 
The first warden was interrupted by another. “Tucker, the girl there fits the description.”
“Really?” Tucker replied. “I thought she’d be plumper.”
“I’m sure Tucker. We better take her in, just in case.” The second said.
Meanwhile Ren was covertly rotating the cylinder of his revolver, precisely selecting the bullet he needed for this situation. Then once he’d found it, he raised his voice. “Let us pass or you will regret it.”
All four wardens let out a bit of a laugh. The Tucker responded to Ren, “Think you’re funny, do ya?”
Ren made no reply, he only steadied his gaze, and prepared his mind.
Tucker continued, “Four wardens against the three of you? The armoured guy might prove worthy of a fight, but the girl doesn’t quite measure up. And you, by the looks of you, I’d say you’re some low level wizard, probably working in surveillance. One of us will be enough for both you and the girl. The other three can take care of mister power armour.”
Ren breathed deep like his father taught him, and he raised his gun.
“The gun won’t help you boy! I told you you’re finished, just give up now before…”
Ren didn’t let Tucker finish. Their was a surge of excitement coursing through his body and he wasn’t able to hold it back any longer. He pulled the trigger.
The instance the trigger was pulled red fiery energy was blasted backward from the gun. The energy fused itself with Ren's body. His eyes lit ablaze with fiery energy, his hair stood on end, the whole of his body seemed to be surrounded by this energy. Yet his expression remained steady.
The shroud of energy expanded suddenly and just as quickly it was all sucked back into the gun. Ren's eyes were the only spot where the energy lingered. The rest of it was channeled through the gun and was heading down the barrel. As it left the barrel a powerful blast occurred. With that blast the energy began to spiral forwards. Two torrents of flame began rushing forward continually spiralling around each other and engulfing the entire room.
The wardens were skilled in all sorts of fighting, but the one area where they lacked most was defense against magic. The wizards being their leaders had justified this by assuring they would rarely need to face magical enemies. But the real reason was to make sure the wardens would be unable to stand against the wizards.
Even still the devastating blast had caught the wardens off guard. Usually such magic would require a good deal of channeling, making it easy to predict and avoid. Ren's bullets allowed him to instantaneously use powerful magic. The combination of these things and Ren's outer appearance is what allowed for such an effective surprise attack. The wardens had been wiped out.
	“Ren…” Chloe began, “What powerful magic.”
	“It’s not that great.” Ren replied, he was crouching to the ground huffing for breath, “I can only do it with the bullets, and even then it takes it’s toll on my body.” Ren's eyes were still ablaze at this point, but the energy was slowly fading.
	Beedel had stood utterly in shock for several moments before he could think of something to say. So he asked, “Your father taught you that?”
	Ren took another couple breaths before answering, “No, Dad never used magic bullets. I failed his teachings, I was never a good shot.” Ren caught his breath and stood up, “I crafted these bullets so that I wouldn’t need to aim.”
	“That’s still so amazing Ren.” Chloe exclaimed.
“Renny you are full of surprises.” Beedel added.
Ren blushed, “Stop it guys. We should get moving.”
The fires had now faded and revealed the charred bodies of the wardens in front of them. Ren wasn’t positive they were dead, but he was sure they wouldn’t be following them to core.

            <Title>The Hunt Goes On</Title>
            <Text>Grummin found himself in an area of the tunnels he had never previously explored, or knew existed for that matter. He was now trusting in the keen senses of his new chimera friend. Whiskers seemed to respond to Grummin’s words, but he was still unsure if the creature truly understood him.
	Grummin has been tracking Corina for what felt like days. It hasn’t been easy either. She was either deliberately covering her tracks or he was way off track. But Whiskers seemed to be sure of the direction, and Grummin had nothing else to go on.
	“All right buddy,” Grummin said, “Let’s find that witch and do the world a favor.”
	Whiskers replied with a light roar. And the two of them ventured further into the dark tunnels.

            <Title>Before The Storm</Title>
            <Text>Beedel was nearing a T junction when he said, “This is it, we’re close.”
	The three of them hadn’t encountered any other wardens in their journey. As the approached the junction they could see a faint light coming from the left hand direction. When they turned the corner they saw it. The entrance to the core. It’s colourful energy swirled throughout the the large room but did not leak into the leading tunnel.
	“Woah.” Ren said. “That’s a lot of energy.”
	“And it’s all coming from the planet’s core.” Beedel added.
	“Let’s end this.” Chloe confirmed.
	The three of them crept forward to the entrance. When they got within a few meters they were able to see more details about the room. The six ebony spikes were firm in their floating. The six pathways leading from various entrances were all unoccupied. Finally the center platform to the room could be seen, although somewhat obstructed by the pillar before them.
	“This is it.” Beedel said, “BugBot’s signal originated here.” Beedel looked around for any sign of the robot. He could be rebuilt if the right parts were found.
	Ren spoke, “Those black pillars. That’s how they do it.”
	“Do what?” Chloe asked.
	“Siphon energy from the core,” Ren continued to explain, “Those spikes are firmly rooted into the energy field of the planet. They are the catalyst which will direct the energy where ever they wish it.” Ren studied the flow of energy for a moment. “But it’s uneven.”
	“What do you mean?” Chloe said.
	“I mean it’s working but not to maximum efficiency. That spike to the right isn’t pulling much energy at all.” Ren said.
	“That could be the one missing an artifact.” Chloe clutched the necklace under her shirt as she spoke.
	“I think you’re right.” Ren responded.
	“He’s not here.” Beedel interrupted, unaware of their conversation.
	“I’m sorry Beedel.” Chloe said.
	“That’s okay.” Beedel replied. “He did well leading us here. I’m very proud of him.”
	“I think I know what to do.” Ren interrupted.
	They both looked to Ren, waiting for him to continue.
	“Right now all this energy is being pulled upward into the city.” He said, “But if I can get access to that control platform I can probably reverse the direction.”
	“That will require some serious delicacy.” Beedel pointed out.
	“And what will happen to the city?” Chloe asked.
	“At best,” Ren started, “Everyone might lose power.”
	“And at worst?” Chloe inquired.
	“I’m not sure. This is a lot of energy.” Ren replied, then he looked up into the height of the chamber. “I think we might be right underneath the Wizard Tower.” 
	“Are you sure you can do this Renny?”Beedel asked.
	“No.” Ren replied. “But I have to try. We can’t let the planet continue to be abused like this. I’m gonna need your help. If we balance the flow of power first, it’ll make things go much more smoothly.”
	“So I have to put my necklace in the spike?” Chloe asked.
	“I think so. I’ll head to the control panels and see what I can do. Beedel you stand guard between both of us.” Ren said. “This room may very well be guarded even though it doesn’t look it.”
	“Aye, captain.” Beedel winked.
	“Chloe.” Ren began, “Can you make us all invisible?”
	“I can try. I’ve never done more than myself before.” She replied.
	“I’ll help stabilize your energy. We need this.” Ren added.
	“I’ll do my best.” She smiled.
	Ren took a couple breaths, faced forward and asked, “Once we cross that threshold, the energy will enable any hiding wizards to sense our presence. The invisibility will help us hide our exact location. But we will need to move quickly. I’ll also be able to sense any threats. I’ll try to warn you of any attacks, but for the most part we need to remain silent.” Ren breathed slowly once more. 
	Beedel drew his sword, Chloe prepared the spell, and Ren double checked his bullets.
	“Okay are we ready?” Ren asked.
	“Aye.”
	“Yes.”
	“Good.” Ren said. “Let’s move.”
	Chloe cast her spell and Ren helped lead the energy around them. Then the three of them moved together into the large chamber.

            <Title>Roadblock</Title>
            <Text>Suddenly Whiskers stopped. His head jutted upward and forward. A low growl began deep in his throat. Grummin similarly sensed a faint presence and prepared his gauntlet. 
	Ahead of them in the distant darkness a pair of glowing yellow-green eyes opened and peered at them. It wasn’t long before the eyes began moving forward. It was however a slow and uneven movement. The eyes wobbled back and forth, left and right, as they moved ever forward.
	In the distance beyond, a cackle broke the silence. In was the shrill voice of Corina and at the sound of her laughing several other sets of glowing eyes opened suddenly behind the first set.
	She yelled out from the safety of the dark, “You filthy lizard! Just die already!”
	“Not before a send you to hell.” Grummin said. He didn’t yell it, and he wasn’t sure he heard it. But none of that mattered, because in Grummin’s mind, it was truth.
	The eyes were now close enough for Grummin to make out the details of their bodies. At the sight of them Grummin nearly erupted in anger. He held it back, but Whiskers was unable to do so.
	Approaching them were several other chimera. Their bodies looked weak, and malnourished. But most unsettling was the decaying flesh hanging off of their corpses. They were dead. Corina’s dark magic had brought them back to life in a state worse than death.
	Whiskers let out a loud roar in despair for his brother and sisters. Then he attacked. Whiskers’s huge jaw latched onto the first chimera’s head. The others moved away with sudden quickness. Whiskers shook the smaller chimera back and forth trying desperately to end it’s unlife.
	He then launched the undead creature and it slammed against the nearby wall. Whiskers momentarily turned it’s attention to the next closest target. When suddenly the previously tossed chimera was moving again.
	Whiskers had a moment of shock and then understanding. He turned his head to look back at Grummin.
	Grummin ignited his gauntlet and assured his new friend, “Okay. I’ll help.”

            <Title>The Beginning Of The End</Title>
            <Text>Ren was the first to cross the threshold. He was stunned to feel such power coursing through his body. After the initial shock he took a moment to sense around the room. He felt no other presences but he remained alert regardless. He signalled the other two to continue moving.
Beedel’s armoured feet made loud clanking noises against the metal walkway. Chloe was all but totally silent. After nothing reacted to Beedel first few steps they continued forward.
Ren whispered, “So didn’t sense anyone else here. But let’s keep the invisibility sphere active just in case.”
“Should we really be talking right now?” Beedel asked.
	“As long as we whisper it’s fine. Besides your feet removed any chance of silently approaching anyhow.” Be responded.
	“Can we get a move on?” Chloe asked. “The energy in here is giving me the creeps.”
	The three of them all acknowledged that and proceeded forward, almost silently.
	As they approached the ebony spike they all examined it carefully. Beedel touched it instinctively. Ren coughed at him and gave him an expression that said, “What are you doing?!”
	Beedel backed off and they continued forward. The platform in the center of the room was quite large. Raised a few feet compared to the walkways and larger than the entirety of Ren's old office. On it were several chairs and monitoring stations. The technology here was years more advanced than the stuff Ren had ever seen, let alone personally used.
	He hopped up onto the platform and began looking around. He left the security of the invisibility sphere confidently. Looking carefully from this higher vantage point Ren could clearly see the walkways and all six floating spikes. The doorways were obstructed and that concerned Ren, but he knew he needed to act now.
	“You two go down that walkway and prepare to insert the artifact.” Ren said. “I’ll stay here and try to figure out how to use this system.”
	Beedel and Chloe nodded, but Ren couldn’t see them anymore. 
	“Okay?” Ren questioned.
	“Aye, sorry.” Beedel responded.
	Then the two of them started moving toward the spike. Ren could hear Beedel’s footsteps getting further away. But now his attention was focused on the technology in front of him. He recognized some of the systems but the interfaces were different. There was a lot more gesture based input then he was accustomed to. 
	As Chloe and Beedel approached the massive black structure Beedel asked, “How do you suppose we open that thing.”
	“Magic, I suppose.” Chloe answered.
	“I suppose that’s right. Can you do it?”
	“Maybe, I’m not formally trained.”
	“But the invisibility sphere?”
	“Ren really helped with that. Invisibility was something I’ve struggled to get around just myself.” Chloe said. “He’s really quite powerful.”
	“Yeah,” Beedel added, “It’s too bad he doesn’t realize it.”
	Ren interrupted them from the distance, “Hey, I think I can get it open from here. Are you ready?”
	“Just about!” Chloe yelled back. Then She removed the necklace from under her shirt and held it up.
	“We’re ready Renny!” Beedel shouted.
	Ren messed with a few controls and suddenly the spike lowered itself and a portion of it became transparent. 
Chloe looked at Beedel, “In there?”
Beedel shrugged a yes.
Chloe lifted the necklace to the opening in the spike. She could feel a force begin pulling the necklace towards the spike. It got stronger the closer she got until she was fighting to hold onto it. Thoughts of her grandmother filled her head. Then she released the necklace. 
It flung into the spike and stopped suddenly in the center, as if it had found it’s home. At that moment everyone in the room felt the rush of power increases. Such power had a sobering effect. But it kept increasing. Slowly the flow of power was increasing.
“Ren. Is this..” Chloe’s voice was cut off. By the sounds of her choking for breath. At the same time her invisibility sphere vanished to reveal that she was a float mid air. Someone was holding her with great force.
Ren saw this ad immediately sensed the room again. After a brief moment he opened his eyes and he knew where the enemy was.
Beedel was desperately trying to pull Chloe back down to the catwalk. The force was pulling her slowly over the edge. Threatening to drop her into the core.
“It’s alright Chloe,” Beedel proclaimed, “I’ll get you down.” But he was unsure he’d be able to get her down at all.
Ren drew his gun and yelled, “Show yourself.” 
Chloe let out a harsh breath. Suddenly being able to breathe again, she was relieved, however she was still dangling partial over the edge of the walkway. 
A booming female voice began to speak, “You are surprisingly skilled Ren Magic.” She ended the sentence with a sensual chuckle. “I’m impressed you could find me. And here I thought I was hiding my presence so well.”
The owner of the voice revealed herself from behind a ebony spike. She was two catwalks away from Chloe and Beedel in the clockwise direction. Her robe was very fashionable and quite revealing. Ren recognized her immediately. There wasn’t a wizard who wouldn’t.
“Elizaborah.” Ren said. “What do you know of this place?”
“It’s not your turn to ask questions.” She responded.
Chloe interrupted, “Ren, this is the woman who killed my grandmother!”
“Grandmother you say?” Elizaborah asked. “That does explain some things. But more questions have arisen.”
“Why are you doing this?” Ren shouted. “You’re a star. A hero to wizards everywhere. Why go along with the Grand Wizards?”
“Those old fools?” Elizaborah replied. “They truly believe they are the source of power in the world. They are blind.”
“All of this is your doing?” Ren asked.
“Yes. I had some help of course.” She replied. “Speaking of which.”
Now on the same catwalk where Chloe floated just out of Beedel’s reach, Krozan entered from the tunnels. His head was down, carefully observing and following a gadget in his hands. When he lifted his head he looked puzzled.
“This ain’t right.’ Krozan said to himself.
He could not see Chloe. Beedel, nor Ren from his perspective.
Elizaborah shouted to him while waving, “Krozan!”
His eyes lit up to see her there and he responded, “Elizaborah, this thing is broke. It didn’t lead me to the girl but back here.”
She smirked and pointed toward the spike in front of him. Krozan leaned his head to peer around it. He noticed them and said, “Oh.”
Elizaborah lowered her hand and Chloe lowered to the ground. She then yelled out to Krozan, “Take care of those two.” 
Beedel quickly checked on Chloe to make sure she was alright.
“I’m fine.” Chloe said. “Go get him. I’ll back you up.”
“Aye.” Beedel confirmed.
Moving swiftly Beedel held his sword and moved to a position to the side of the spike. Him and Krozan made eye contact. A salute between enemies occurred silently between them. Beedel took his stance. Krozan face was still mostly bandaged. He ripped them off to reveal several scars from serious burns. His two gauntlets were oversized for his arms yet he seemed to be completely at ease in their use. He stretched his arms out a little bit and took his own battle stance.
Elizaborah walked slowly towards Ren and the center platform. Ren was splitting his focus between her and the console to his right. He was pretty sure he could reverse the power flow. But not before she reached the platform. He’d have to stop her, or at the very least, slow her down.
“Oh Ren. Why do you resist?” Elizaborah asked. “You're standing inside a source of incredible power. Now that that all the etherium artifacts are in place, the array is complete. We can take full advantage of all the power this planet has to offer.”
“Power that can not be stabilized.” Ren returned. He then grabbed his gun and turned the barrel. “You cannot expect to pull energy from the core of our planet without any consequence.” Once he found his bullet, Ren shot at the ground of the walkway between him and Elizaborah. This bullet pulled energy from Ren, but Ren was surprised to realize that he didn’t feel as weak as he normally would afterwards.
The bullet left and icy trail behind it as it flew. Once it connected with the walkway jagged ice spikes erupted from the ground. These spikes continued forward towards Elizaborah. She however raise her hand slightly and melted the spikes that would have hit her before they could reach her.
She continue stepping forward, the ice melting he she approached. “You see don’t you Ren. Simply being here increases our power. Imagine what it could be like when you directly tap into it.” Elizaborah said.
‘’But you will destroy the planet in the process!” Ren yelled.
“There are other planets Ren.” She replied.
“And the people? The innocent civilians. The wizards who idolize you. What about them!”
“Necessary sacrifices.” Elizaborah added, “There is a bigger threat Ren. We are just a tiny planet, playing a miniscule part in the universal play. I aim to change that.”
“I won’t let you.” Ren said, while he rotated the barrel again and aimed directly at her this time.
“What can you do with that Ren?” Elizaborah scoffed.
“Much more than you realize.” Ren smirked.
There was pause. Ren was focusing his mind. Solphas had taught him that only those with extreme focus could master the golden bullets. Ren had one shot and he was prepared to use it now.
On the other side of the room, Krozan began his assault. Charging directly toward Beedel. Both had revved up their power armour to full charge. As soon as Krozan was within a few steps his keen senses picked up footsteps coming around the other side of the spike. 
Beedel took advantage of this momentary distraction and swung deep for Krozan’s exposed core. No connection, Krozan switched directions to focus on these new footsteps. He suspected the Chloe was preparing for a sneak attack. 
He rounded the past the spike at was surprised to see Chloe crouching a good distance away. Beedel surprised him even more by being suddenly in front of him again with a sweeping attack. Beedel’s thrusters were in full blast and he was much quicker than Krozan anticipated in such a heavy looking armour.
Krozan jumped backwards just in time, but he still need to deflect the attack with his gauntlet. Suddenly before Krozan’s eyes Beedel had disappeared. He could see Chloe casting some magic in the background and backed up again.
Now Krozan was listening intently for the clang of metal footsteps. When he heard them, it was surprisingly fast. Beedel was charging forward still invisible. But at the last moment the invisibility vanished and a large red armoured figure was much too close for Krozan’s comfort.
Krozan was not able to completely defend himself. Beedel had landed several light hits. Beedel’s power sword had cut several chunks out of Krozan’s gauntlets. They were still functional, but they wouldn’t be if this kept up.
“Enough tricks.” Krozan yelled. “Fight me with honour!”
Beedel lifted his face plate, to reveal his identity and that he was smirking.
“A sapling?” Krozan said. “How rare.” He followed his words with a laugh.
“Chloe,” Beedel called out to her without breaking eye contact with Krozan, “I got it from here. Go help Ren.”
“Are you sure?” Chloe yelled back.
“Yes. Hurry.” Beedel confirmed. Then he continued, “Ready for round 2?”
“Enough games you weed.” Krozan snarled.
Ren was nearly ready to use his secret weapon. When he opened his eyes Elizaborah was nearly within reach. She was walking calmly towards him. 
Ren was about the pull the trigger when she starting laughing uncontrollably.
“You really are something Ren Magic.” Elizaborah said mid laugh. “I assume you never went back to check on your workshop.”
Ren's heart froze.
“That’s right Ren.” Elizaborah pulled out a gun of her own. It was no rusty revolver like Ren's hand me down. Elizaborah’s weapon was ornate, large, and fused with arcane technology. “I have two of your golden bullets.”
“You’re buffing.” Bne prayed.
“Why don’t we test it and find out.” Elizaborah moved her aim to just behind Ren.
Ren turned his head to see what she was now aiming it. It was Chloe, who was just now jumping up onto the center platform. Chloe didn’t immediately notice the gun pointed at her until Ren yelled.
“Chloe stop!”
But the warning was much too late. Elizaborah pulled the trigger and a golden energy surged through her body and poured into the gun. The blast was soft. Unlike any normal bullet. There was a few moments where nothing happened. Ren thought for a moment that the golden bullet was a dud, or maybe Elizaborah was bluffing. But all that hope was crushed when he heard Chloe scream.
Ren began to run to her. But Elizaborah stopped him with her magic. He was frozen in place, he couldn’t even look to see what had happened to Chloe.
“No no no Ren. I’m not done with you. I still have one more bullet.” Elizaborah smirked.
“Let me go. She’s dying.” Ren snarled.
“No she’s not.”
Ren was puzzled.
“I wouldn’t waste such a valuable weapon on simply killing her.” Elizaborah revealed. “I plan to keep her very much alive.”
“What do you mean.” Ren demanded.
“Settle down Ren. I’ve connected your dear Chloe’s soul to this place. If you destroy this facility your little friend will perish as well.”
Ren hadn’t known Chloe for very long, but that didn’t change his feelings. All he could do was scream. Their plan had been foiled already.
At least that was Ren's initial thought. But he fought those familiar feelings of despair and began searching for a solution. To his surprise it came rather quickly. He still had a golden bullet, he could fix this.
“And now Ren,” Elizaborah interrupted his train of thought. “It looks like Krozan has a handle on your other friend over there. That leaves only one loose end.” She smirked.
Elizaborah raised her gun to Ren's head. “Now I will use a golden bullet to turn you into a vegetable. You’ll mindlessly serve me for years to come. It would be so nice to have another obedient servant. Well for you I imagine it’ll be a living hell.” Elizaborah laughed at her own joke.
Ren struggled to fight the magic withstraining him. But Elizaborah was too strong and the core’s energy was making her even stronger.
“Any final words?” She asked.
“This isn’t the end.” Ren said with terrifying confidence.
Elizaborah hesitated for just a moment and then regained her composure. “Goodnight Ren.”
Beedel and Krozan were locked in conflict. Equally matched they had both received severe wounds. They were now both breathing heavily taking a moment to rest. Beedel had previously ignored the screams and gunshots. It pained him to do so, but he needed all of his focus to fight KRozan.
“You fight honourably for a Arborians.” Krozan said. “What is your name?”
“Beedel. Mach-Henery.” Beedel replied. “Yours?”
“Krozan Irontooth. Leader of the wardens.” Krozan replied.
“I’ve fought a warden before, he was much stronger than you.” Beedel laughed.
“Your insults mean nothing weed.”
“Well then you won’t like this much either.” Beedel smirked. He flew upward and hovered in the air for a moment. The pain in his gut was intense. He spit up blue blood. 
Krozan prepared his stance. He was dealing with a good deal of pain himself.
Beedel lowered his face guard and redirected nearly all his power to his blades. The energy pouring out of them was intense.
“You can’t keep this up Beedel!” Krozan yelled. “You’ll run out of juice soon and then you’re mine!”
Beedel ignored him. And began a sword first dive down towards Krozan. Krozan hadn’t expected such a sloppy attack and prepared his own energy into his remaining single functioning gauntlet.
As Beedel approached his speed increased. And when he was within ten meters, all the power from his swords was directed back into his rear thrusters. This propelled Beedel forward at an intense pace nearly tripling his previous speed.
Grummin couldn’t anticipate this a jumped back to safety. But Beedel did not change his trajectory to chase Krozan. Beedel pushed forward through the floor of the walkway. It had been previously weakened by several of their attacks. But now Beedel was intending to destroy it completely.
He was successful. The walkway collapsed like butter under that much force. The destruction rippled the entire structure and it began collapsing in two spots. Where Beedel smashed it and at the connection to the wall, where the tunnels resumed.
Krozan looked back to analyze his escape, but it was too late. The platform he was on was already plummeting. So he stood proud and accepting of his defeat.
“It wasn’t honourable. But it was damn clever.” Krozan said as he passed by Beedel who had regained his floating stance. Beedel’s face guard was open and he had the most infuriating smile Krozan had ever seen.
From below Beedel heard a second soft gunshot. And he struggled to propel himself up to the platform. His thrusters were losing power quickly and he was still quite far down. He coughed up more blood. But through sheer willpower he forced himself to keep going.
Elizaborah pulled the trigger.
Everything after that happened so quickly. Solphas had taught Ren that focus was the most important factor when using the golden bullets. It was because they have a natural delay, between pulling the trigger and the manifestation of the desired effect. So if the user lost focus in those brief moments then the effect would be altered sometimes producing very dangerous results.
Even though Ren knew all this he was unable to act. Elizaborah’s power was too strong for him to break free. That’s when he saw them. 
Three new players had just entered the room. The first was lightning fast. A small old roden woman. She looked scared and was running directly for Elizaborah.
Between the rat woman, was a large creature Ren assumed to be a chimera. No wonder the rat was scared, she was being chased. However she was much quicker than the large beast.
Finally Grummin entered last. Ren had never been so happy to see his bond brother as he was at this moment.
The rat’s speed was shocking. But it was her screeching that caught everyone’s attention. It was a shrill sound, and she was nearly in tears by the time she reached Elizaborah’s leg. But the rat didn’t stop there, she scurried up Elizaborah in her panic to get away from the predator chasing her.
Elizaborah screamed out at Corina for interrupting her and got even more enraged when the rat began to climb on top of her. Ren made note of this and hope returned to his heart.
Suddenly as Elizaborah tried to forcefully remove Corina from her person, Corina exploded. It was a bloody rat mess, and most of it was covering Elizaborah.
“What the fuck!” she screamed.
“You lost control.” Ren replied. He turned towards Grummin who was now half way across the walkway, following just behind the chimera. “Grummin we need a hand here.”
Elizaborah was momentarily stunned and Ren took the opportunity to break free from her grasp. He rushed to Chloe’s side. “Are you hurt, Chloe?”
“I’m okay.” She replied. “But I can’t move very well.”
“Well you might have to pretty soon.” Ren added.
As Ren began helping Chloe up. Beedel surfaced from below the platform. His thrusters gave out as he pushed himself above the edge. He landed, roughly, on the platform. On the other side of the platform the chimera jumped up with grace and Grummin followed a little less gracefully. 	“Ren, what’s going on here?” Grummin asked as he looked around to assess the scene. “And where did that rat go?”
“Well,” Ren began, “that woman is covered in the rat you were chasing. And I think we’re trying to save the world.”
“Is Beedel okay?” Gumming asked.
“What?” Ren questioned. Then he saw Beedel laying on the ground motionless. “No Beedel.”
“Look after her, I’ll get Beedel.” Grummin said.
“Okay.” Ren continued helping Chloe up.
“Umm, Ren.” Chloe said.
“Yeah?” Ren replied.
“What are we going to do about her?” Chloe asked.
Ren looked over to Elizaborah. She was still covered in rat guts but she hadn’t moved. She was clearly very angry, nearly fuming. But with her eyes shut she seemed to be centering herself. Trying to suppress the rage.
“Let’s take advantage of the situation and escape.” Ren said.
“But what about the planet’s core?” Chloe asked. “There are thousands of lives at stake here.”
“That doesn’t matter anymore.” Ren pleaded. “I need to get you out of here.”
Grummin reached Beedel within a few seconds and began to assess his damage.
“Beedel.” He said. “Can you hear me?” Grummin paused waiting for a response. “Beedel!” He continued, “C'mon Beedel. You’re the bravest Arborian I’ve ever met. You can’t die here. Not without a rematch.”
“Thank you.” Beedel laughed. Then he coughed up some more blood. “You’re a good draconian.” 
Grummin shook his head. “You were faking weren’t you?”
“I wanted to see what you’d say.” Beedel smiled. “I wasn’t disappointed.”
“Funny.” Grummin laughed. “But we’re going to need your help. Our enemy is a powerful wizard.”
“I think I’m pretty much at my limit now.” Beedel coughed. He looked to Grummin and asked, “Where’s the rest of your armour?”
“I lost it fighting my uncle.” Grummin replied. “Curse you Krozan.” He added to himself.
But Beedel overheard. “Krozan Irontooth?” He asked.
“Yeah, you know him?” Grummin asked.
“Know him, I just killed him.” Beedel laughed and then he coughed.
“Your kidding.” Grummin said.
“He was quite the guy.” Beedel added.
Grummin was silent. He didn’t quite know how to handle this news.
“I’m sorry if I stole your kill.” Beedel said.
“No, it’s better if he’s gone.” Grummin replied.
“But listen,” Beedel coughed, “I can give you a small gift in exchange.”
“I don’t think now is really the time.” Grummin professed.
But Beedel’s armour had already begun to open up. The large suit of armour continued to shift and change it’s shape.
“Take this. It’ll serve you well.” Beedel said.
“Beedel this is your armour.” Grummin said.
“It’s not doing me any good right now. Take it and kick that bitch’s ass for all of us.” Beedel insisted.
“Okay.” Grummin removed Beedel from the shell and placed him gently on the platform. He then picked up the armour and it began a scan of his body that lasted for merely seconds. It then began modeling itself to fit Grummin. The armour didn’t have enough material to create a full suit but it did create a mighty fine chest plate and a pair of solid full arm gauntlets.
“Beedel this is amazing.” Grummin marveled.
Beedel began, “You need to channel your energy through the…”
“I’m not new to this.” Grummin interrupted as he fired up the thrusters. “This is going to be fun.” 
Elizaborah was no longer stunned. Her cool demeanor had returned and even in the face of several enemies she maintained her confidence. 
Ren was standing to face her. Chloe behind him was struggling to hold herself up against a terminal. Standing proud beside Ren was the chimera Whiskers. Whiskers didn’t seem hostile toward them, so Ren figured he was on their side. Whiskers was however very hostile towards Elizaborah. Ren wondered if that was due to the rat remains on Elizaborah’s clothes, or if there was something else Whiskers sensed.
Elizaborah finally broke the silence, “Well that was unexpected.” Then with a wave of her arms all of the rat debris around her ejected itself from her body and collected into a small orb in front of her.
“You’re outnumbered.” Ren declared.
“And you’re outmatched.” She rebuttled. With another cast of her hand the orb of rat was launched forward toward them.
Whiskers intercepted it with ferocity. Then he continued moving forward to Elizaborah, fangs showing. Elizaborah barely even flinched as she tossed him aside with a blast of invisible energy.
But that didn’t put an end to the assault. Whisker’s attacks continued and so did Elizaborah’s perfect defense. She never let her gaze stray. She had locked eyes with Ren.
Ren was holding his gun up, ready to fire. The golden bullet loaded and ready. But Ren was having trouble. He had focus, but he didn’t have a clear goal. The bullet could do no good without. His mind struggled to find just the right goal. Afterall he only had one shot. 
He could only watch as Whiskers was beat down over and over. Every hit worsening his overall condition. Every moment made it more difficult for Ren to define his desire.
“Alright.” Elizaborah said after dealing a severe blow to the chimera leaving him immobile on the walkway. “Playtime is over. If you’re not going to use it, you might as well give up now.” She smiled a sinister smile.
“Never. What you’re doing is wrong!” Ren shouted as he cocked the hammer.
“You no nothing of right or wrong Ren.” Elizaborah returned. “The world is so much more vast than you could ever comprehend. Your father understood that.”
“What do you know of my father?” Ren demanded.
“I know that he’s not here right now. Not with you saving the world.” Elizaborah laughed. “Stop the siphon, don’t stop the siphon. We’re doomed either way. I plan to save myself.” A dark energy erupted from Elizaborah’s back. The energy molded into several arms, each wielded a dark blade. “Now, hand over the gun. And I will make your deaths relatively painless.” One of the dark arms reached out with a open hand, easily gapping the distance between her and Ren.
“Ren don’t do it.”Chloe pleaded.
“I’m not strong enough to fight her Chloe.” Ren responded.
“Yes you are.” Chloe said.
“No you really aren’t.” Elizaborah snarled. Then her blade wielding arms flung themselves towards Ren. Ren stood his ground valiantly and idiotically protecting Chloe. He had forgotten that Elizaborah needed her alive. And then he remembered, Elizaborah needed her alive.
Suddenly a large figure rushed past Ren with thrusters burning at full force. Ren was hopeful to see Beedel, but was shocked to realize it wasn’t beedel at all. But rather Grummin using a transformed version of Beedel’s armour. Ren looked back and saw Beedel, lying naked on the ground at the other end of the platform.
Grummin intercepted the magical arms. Grummin was fast on the best of days, but combined with Beedel advanced armour, Grummin was like lightning. He was holding his own against four massive arcane appendages. You might even say he had the upper hand as he pushed Elizaborah’s arms back.
“Ren,” Chloe began, “The console. Let’s do it now.”
“Right.” Ren shook off his thoughts and moved to her side.
Ren had made progress getting access to the terminal panel, but now that he was in he didn’t really know what he was looking at. He was only trained in monitoring, he wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t recognize many of the terms and settings.
“So what do we do Ren?” Chloe asked.
	“I’m looking.” Ren said. “I can’t find any off switches.” 
	“Well maybe try looking into there.” Chloe pointed to a icon labeled ‘Flow’.
	“Maybe,” Ren was unsure. “Let’s try it.” Ren hit the icon and a new screen appeared. He glanced through the terms trying to find the right one.
	Meanwhile Grummin’s fight was going sour and fast. Elizaborah had grown several more limbs and Grummin was having a hard time keeping up.
	“Can we get a move on Ren.” Grummin yelled back.
	“Almost got it.” Ren shouted. He took another glance at the panel. “I don’t know Chloe, I think it’s best if we just try to escape.”
	“What about this one.” Chloe said as she reached out and tapped an icon.
	Ren hadn’t even seen that icon and he knew it was because he didn’t want to see it. “Chloe no!” He yelled in vain.
	The room began to sway and the flow of magic began to slow. This created an overwhelming sense of dizziness for everyone in the room. Grummin and Elizaborah paused their fighting, but neither put away their weapons.
It felt as though the whole room was flying in sideways spirals. But within a few moments things seemed to stabilize. 
“Stop what you are doing!” Elizaborah yelled. “You’re friend will die if you keep this up.”  She launched a bladed arm towards Ren.
Grummin intercepted with a smile, “Did you forget about me already?”
Elizaborah screamed and began attacking Grummin with all her force
“What does she mean Ren?” Chloe asked.
Ren realized Chloe hadn’t heard Elizaborah’s explanation. “We can’t stop her,” Ren began, “without killing you.”
Chloe was silent.
“She used a golden bullet to merge your soul with this place. We might be able to stop the flow, but we can’t destroy this place without losing you.” Ren explained.
Chloe thought for a moment. “Then shoot me.”
“What?” Ren said.
“It must work both ways. If you kill me, we stop the machine.” Chloe elaborated.
“I... I… That... might be right, but…” Ren stuttered.
“It’s alright Ren.” Chloe said. “I’ve had a good run. I was really spoiled for a while. Then a had a whole lot of fun, maybe too much. And lastly I’ve gotten to go on this great adventure with you.”
Ren didn’t know what he could say.
“Go on now. Take Beedel and at that other guy with you. Escape and save the world.” Chloe grabbed Ren's gun with both of her hands and lifted it to her head. “Go on Ren. Make a wish.” 
Chloe closed her eyes and began breathing deeply, preparing herself for her fate.
‘I can’t do that Chloe.” Ren admitted.
“Ren, you only met me yesterday. Are you saying you have feelings for me?” Chloe asked.
“I don’t know what I’m saying but I can’t shoot you.” Ren said.
“That’s enough Ren.” Chloe said calmly. “Look, your friend is in trouble and if you don’t act quickly he will die.”
Ren looked over and saw Grummin fighting to protect them.
“And over there Beedel is lying face down, bleeding to death. He needs help soon or else he will also die.”
Ren looked back at Beedel. Seeing his new friend in such a state brought deep pain to Ren.
“Now listen carefully Ren.” Chloe began, “You still have a golden bullet right?”
Ren nodded.
“Good.” Chloe closed her eyes. “Now use it. Use it to end my life, painlessly if you don’t mind.” She smiled, but Ren could see the fear in her eyes. The fear reminded Ren of his mother, as she was dying in a hospital bed she gave Ren the same eyes and told him that he was strong, that he would be okay. 
Ren's mother was wrong. He hadn’t been okay for a very long time. He didn’t believe he was strong.
But in a full circle twist of a fate Chloe said, “You’re strong Ren. It’ll be okay.”
In that moment Ren had a goal. He gripped his pistol tight and spoke, “Thank you Chloe.” Ren pulled the trigger. The golden glow surrounded him and it was intensely bright. It temporarily blinded Elizaborah and allowed Grummin to get a hit in knocking her back a few meters. 
But Grummin saw the light too. Curious he turned to see what was happening. Ren was totally shrouded in golden white light. It was pouring from him into his gun. But more impressively all six of the large black spikes were glowing gold as well. Their energy was flowing into Ren adding more fuel to the power of his wish. 
Elizaborah was seeing her plan fail. Enraged she took advantage of Grummin’s distracted state and rushed past him. She had shrouded herself in a violet black aura. She flew fast toward Ren aiming to rend him in half with her arcane claws. She was desperate to distract him. To ruin his wish as the rat Corina had ruined hers.
	She was fast. But greater than her speed was Ren's focus and concentration. Elizaborah ripped Ren apart and sent the pieces flying with a single slash. Ren's expression never wavered.
	The intensity of the golden light from the six spikes grew. With it the pressure in the room built itself up. Until the room could handle it no longer. 
	Everything started to collapse.

            <Title>The End</Title>
            <Text>The Wizard Tower collapsed. Many perished in the catastrophe and very few knew the cause. Some claimed it was a secret wizard experiment gone horribly wrong. Others claimed it was a revolutionary act. Everyone had a theory.
	From the Rendall estate three figures looked out and watched the tower collapsing with a kind of relief. The huge beam of light that always flowed upward, as a beacon of the city, went dark.
“So what happens now?” Grummin asked.
“How do we move on without him?” Beedel added.
“We do what we’ve always done.” Chloe replied. “We survive.”
“How did we get here?” Beedel asked. “Wasn’t I hurt?”
“Ren saved us.” Chloe said.
“I don’t understand it either,” Grummin added. “But, yeah he did.”
They all watched silently as the Tower collapsed. Mourning their lost friend.
“I suppose it’s not over yet.” Beedel said.
“We just toppled the government.” Grummin responded. “What more is there?”
“They’ll be coming soon.” Chloe said.
“Yeah.” Beedel added. “Who will answer, when they ask what happened to their power supply?
“We will.’ Chloe replied. “And we will fight to protect our world if necessary.”
“What are you two on about?” Grummin pleaded.
“The real battle has just begun.” Chloe said. “We’ll explain later.”
	Beedel sighed. “I miss Renny.”
	“Yeah.” Grummin added.
	“We all do.” Chloe concluded.
