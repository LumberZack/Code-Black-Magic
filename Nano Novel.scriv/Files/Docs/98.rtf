\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Grummin found himself in an area of the tunnels he had never previously explored, or knew existed for that matter. He was now trusting in the keen senses of his new chimera friend. Whiskers seemed to respond to Grummin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words, but he was still unsure if the creature truly understood him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \tab Grummin has been tracking Corina for what felt like days. It hasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been easy either. She was either deliberately covering her tracks or he was way off track. But Whiskers seemed to be sure of the direction, and Grummin had nothing else to go on.}
